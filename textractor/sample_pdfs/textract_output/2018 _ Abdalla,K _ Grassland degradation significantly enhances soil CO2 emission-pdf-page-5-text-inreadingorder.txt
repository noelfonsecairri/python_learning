highest in non-degraded grassland soils and least in highly degraded
grassland soils (Fig. 4A-B). The non-degraded grassland SOCs were
176% higher than in moderately degraded grassland, and 754%
higher than in highly degraded grassland (Fig. 4A). The SOCc also
decreased with increasing grassland degradation, in the following
order; non-degraded (15.72 + moderately degraded
(5.69 + 0.66 > highly degraded (1.84 +
(Fig. 4B).
Soil organic nitrogen stocks (SONs) and content (SONc) followed a
similar behaviour by decreasing from non-degraded to highly degraded
grassland (Fig. 4C-D). The non-degraded grassland SONs were 167%
higher than highly degraded grassland (Fig. 4C). The SONc decreased
sharply from non-degraded to moderately degraded grassland before
decreasing further in the highly degraded grassland; however, there
was no significant difference between moderately and highly degraded
grasslands (Fig. 4D).
3.2.2. Soil bulk density and clay content
Soil bulk density tended to increase with grassland degradation,
from an average of 1.3 cm in non-degraded grassland to 1.5 cm
in highly degraded grassland (Fig. 4E). However, there was no sig-
nificant difference between moderately and highly degraded grass-
lands. It was interesting that topsoil (0-0.05m clay content increased
with grassland degradation (Fig. 4F), meaning that the topsoil clay
content increased in an upslope direction. Non-degraded grassland clay
content was 36 and 59% lower than moderately and highly degraded
grasslands, respectively.
3.2.3. Soil water content and temperature
Overall, average topsoil water content was highest in non-degraded
and lowest in highly degraded grassland (Fig. 5A), implying lower
water retention with lower vegetation cover. However, there was no
significant difference between non-degraded and moderately degraded
grasslands. The overall mean topsoil temperature was highest in mod-
erately degraded grassland (25.8'C and lowest in highly degraded
grassland (21.89 (Fig. 5B). There was also no significant difference
between non-degraded and moderately degraded grasslands. The tem-
poral evolution of soil temperature changed markedly over time
(Fig. 6). The lowest temperature amongst the degradations levels was
observed in July of 2013 and 2014, in highly degraded grassland,
and the maximum temperature was 45 observed in February 2015, in
moderately degraded grassland.

3.2.4. Aboveground biomass production
degradation intensities during the study period are shown in Fig. 7. As
expected, non-degraded grassland had the highest biomass production
of 3.28 + year which was 55 and 81% higher than for
moderately and highly degraded grassland, respectively. This result was
consistent with trend in soil water content (Fig. 5A) and implied greater
soil fertility in non-degraded than the moderately and highly degraded
grassland sites.

and stocks (r = 0.83 and 0.82, respectively) (Table 2). Soil organic
nitrogen (r = 0.67 and 0.53 for SONc and SONs, respectively) and
water content (0.75) showed strongly positive correlations with gross
soil CO2 emission as well. However, gross CO2 emission decreased
significantly with clay content (-0.89). On the other hand, soil CO2
emission relative to SOCs decreased with both SOCc (r - 0.50), SOCs
-0.51), SONc (-0.45) and SONs (-0.42). The repeated ANOVA re-
sults indicated that grasslands degradation level, date of CO2 mea-
surement and the interactions between them also had highly significant
effects (P < 0.001) on the soil CO2 emissions (Table 3).
the dataset (Fig. 8A). Axis 1, which described 44% of the variance, was
positively correlated to SOCc, SOCs, SONc, C:N ratio and SONs
(Fig.8A). Axis 2, describing 33% of the variation in data was negatively
correlated with clay content and positively correlated with soil water
content, and highly correlates with soil degradation intensity (eroded
soils show outcropping dense and clayey B horizons). The gross CO2-C
emissions decreased with decreasing soil degradation. The other PCA
shows that axis 2 and axis 3 accounted for 56% of the CO2 variation
