3.1. Impact of grassland degradation on soil CO2 emission
The study period mean daily gross soil CO2 emissions was 11 and 62%
higher in non-degraded (1.78 + than moder-
ately and highly degraded grassland, respectively (Table 1). Gross soil CO2
fluxes varied in response to both precipitation and air temperature
(Fig. 1A), but were generally higher in non-degraded than moderately and
highly degraded grasslands (Fig. 1B). The annual precipitations were 718
and 562 mm in 2013 and 2014, respectively, with about 90% of the
precipitation occurring in summer (November to April). The mean annual
air temperature was 170 for both years. Differences in gross soil CO2
emissions between non-degraded and highly degraded grasslands were
only significant during 17 of the 39 sampling events, mostly in summer.
The final cumulative soil CO2 emission was highest under non-degraded
grassland (1.12 + 0.02 CO2-Cm (Fig. 1C). However, this was
significantly different from that of moderately degraded grassland
(0.97 + 0.13 CO2-CmT Nevertheless, the final non-degraded
grassland cumulative gross soil CO2 emissions was 62% higher than on
non-degraded grassland.
In contrast, soil CO2 emission relative to SOCs was significantly
higher in both moderately (0.058 + 0.005 and
highly degraded grasslands (0.040 + 0.004 CO2-Cg than
non-degraded
(Table 1). This result indicates that soil CO2 emission relative to SOCs
increased by 71% from non-degraded to moderately degraded grass-
land, and by only 18% from non-degraded to highly degraded

grassland. The soil CO2 emissions relative to SOCs also varied over time
with both precipitation and temperature (Fig. 2A). Moderately de-
graded grassland had generally higher soil CO2 fluxes, especially during
summer months (October to April); however, soil CO2 emission differ-
ences between grass cover levels were only significant for 5 of the 27
summer sampling events (Fig. 2B). The cumulative soil CO2 emission
relative to SOCs was highest in moderately degraded grassland
(2.3 + 2gCO2-Cg-lc) followed by highly degraded
(1.6 + and least in the non-degraded grasslands
(1.4 + CO2-Cg (Fig. 2C). However, there was no sig-
nificant difference between highly degraded and non-degraded grass-
was lowest in the non-degraded grassland at 0.15 + 0.05 kg CO2-
Ckg biomass year (Table 1). This was almost 3.5 and 5 fold lower
than in moderately and highly degraded grasslands, respectively. The
cumulative soil CO2 emission relative to yearly produced biomass was
also significantly higher under highly degraded than non-degraded
grassland, at about 613% by end of the second year of the survey
(2014-2015). While, there was no significant soil CO2 emission relative
to biomass difference between moderately degraded and highly de-
graded grasslands in the first production cycle, the two differed by 47%
in the second production cycle with the highly degraded grassland
