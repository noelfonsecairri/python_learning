Grassland degradation reduces net primary production and, subsequently, soil fertility and soil organic carbon stocks
(SOCs); however, little is known about its impact on soil CO2 emissions, particularly the emissions relative to SOCs
and biomass produced. The main objective of this study, performed in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, was
to quantify the impact of grass basal cover, as main indicator of grassland degradation, on soil CO2 emissions. The soil
CO2 emissions were measured from three grass cover levels (non-degraded, with 100% grass cover; moderately
degraded: 25 < grass cover < 50%; and highly degraded: 0 < grass cover < 5%) using a LI-COR 6400XT. The
measurements were done at three randomly selected positions in each grass cover level, from January 2013 to April
2015. At each position, measurements were done once during winter months and twice during summer months,
resulting in a total of 1053 measurements for the entire study period. The measured average gross soil CO2 emission
was significantly higher (1.78 + day- in non-degraded than moderately (1.60 + 0.12g CO2-
Cm and highly degraded grasslands (0.68 + However, when expressed re-
lative to SOCs and aboveground biomass produced, the trends were opposite. Average soil CO2 emission relative to
SOCs was lowest in the non-degraded grassland (0.034 + 0.01 and highest in the moderately
degraded grassland (0.058 + 0.02 with the highly degraded grassland being intermediate
(0.04 -+ CO2 day Similarly, soil CO2 emission relative to aboveground biomass produced was lowest
in the non-degraded grassland at 0.15 + biomass year which was almost 5 fold lower than
0.73 + 0.01 biomass in the highly degraded grassland. Gross soil CO2 emission correlated
significantly and positively with SOC (r - 0.83 and 0.82 for SOC content and stocks, respectively), SON (0.67 and
0.53 for content and stocks, respectively), C:N ration (0.62), and soil water content (0.75) but negatively with clay
content -0.89). Soil CO2 emission relative to SOCs correlated significantly and negatively with both SOC -0.50
and -0.51 for content and stocks, respectively) and SON (-0.45 and - 0.42 for content and stocks, respectively).
While gross CO2 emissions decreased with grassland degradation, CO2 emission relative to both SOCs and above-
ground biomass increased with grassland degradation. These results point to direct links between grassland de-
gradation and global warming because CO2 is one of the key greenhouse gases. Therefore, strategies for rehabilitating
degraded grasslands need to aim at reducing soil CO2 emission in order to mitigate climate change.
produce food and fodder (FAO, 1979), is generally attributed to human
activities, especially changes in land use and/or land mismanagement
(Shang and Long, 2007; Gang et al., 2014; Fassnacht et al., 2015).
Approximately 50% of global grasslands are reportedly already de-
graded (Gang et al., 14).Grassland degradation, generally regarded a
reduction in soil basal cover, has well-known negative consequences on
grass production and biodiversity (UNEP, 2007; Dong et al. 2012). The
reduction in soil basal cover results in significantly lower soil

1. Introduction
The increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration, due to
anthropogenic disturbances, is a matter of great concern. Grasslands
play a crucial role in the global carbon (C) cycle as they cover 40% of
the world surface area and store about 10% of the soil C stock of
2400 Pg (1 Pg - 1015 8 - 1 billion tons) (Suttie et al. 2005). Land de-
gradation, defined as a process which lowers the capability of soils to
