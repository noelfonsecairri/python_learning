MI). The total soil C was considered equivalent to SOCc since no re-
action was obtained following addition of HC1. SOCs and SONs (SON
stocks) were calculated using the equation by Batjes (1996):
SOCs SOCc pb X T 1 -
where SOCs is the soil organic carbon stock (kg Cm 2); SOCc is soil
organic carbon content in the 2 mm soil material (g Ckg soil); pb is
the bulk density of the soil (kg m 3); T is the thickness of the soil layer
(m); PF is the proportion of fragments of > 2 mm in percent; and b is a
constant equal to 0.001.
The soil bulk density was determined from undisturbed soil samples
collected by inserting metallic cylinders of 7.5 cm diameter and 5 cm
height into the topsoil layers. The undisturbed samples were stored in
hermetic plastic cans immediately after collection and later dried in an
oven at 105 C for 24 h. The soil bulk density was determined according
to Grossman and Reinsch (2002)
2.6. Aboveground biomass
The aboveground biomass (kg m 2 year-1) year was evaluated in three
randomly placed metallic quadrats (0.5 m 0.5 m) in each grass cover

level within a distance of 0.2 to 1 m radius from the CO2 emissions
measurements collars at peak biomass in June 2013 and 2014. All shoot
material from the soil surface to the crown within the quadrats was
clipped. The plant samples were oven-dried at 70 'C and then weighed
until constant weight.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Overall mean and standard error were calculated for gross soil CO2
emissions, and soil CO2 emissions relative to SOCs and biomass production
for the three grass cover levels. Since the soil CO2 emission measurements
were performed at regular time intervals from the same points, the data
were statistically analysed using repeated-measures analysis of variance.
The average soil CO2 emissions for the grass cover levels were compared
using Tukey's for multiple comparisons, a significant threshold defined as
P < 0.05, unless otherwise specified In addition, cumulative soil CO2
emissions were also analysed using REML repeated measure ANOVA. The
final cumulative values were compared using the Tukey test. All analyses
were performed using Genstat (version 14, VSN International, UK, 2011).
In addition, coefficients of determination (r) and principal component
analysis (PCAs) were carried out to evaluate the relationships between the
