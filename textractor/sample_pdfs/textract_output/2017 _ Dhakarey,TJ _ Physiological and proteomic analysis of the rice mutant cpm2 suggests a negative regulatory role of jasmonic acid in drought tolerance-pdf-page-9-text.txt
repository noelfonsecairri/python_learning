FIGURE 6 I Effect of drought on enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis and their transcript levels. (A) Overview of the jasmonic acid pathway with log ratios
(stress/control) for AOC and OPR7protein are shown in boxes, respectively. Transcript abundances of mRNAs encoding (B) AOC and (C) OPR7 protein were analyzed
at control, moderate and severe drought stress conditions. Wild type (WT) and cpm2 are represented by blue and red bars, respectively. Data represents mean value
