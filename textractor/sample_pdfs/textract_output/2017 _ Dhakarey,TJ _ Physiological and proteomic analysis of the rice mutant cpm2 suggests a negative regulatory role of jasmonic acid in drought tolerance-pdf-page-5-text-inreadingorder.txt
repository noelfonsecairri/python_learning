drastic decrease than in the WT (Figure 2B) Initially, during the
first couple of days after the onset of drought conditions, stomatal
conductance in WT showed significant increase compared to
cpm2. However, at day three, the stomatal conductance for both
the genotypes decreased significantly, however both maintained
almost similar degree of conductance. From day four, the trend
was reversed and stomatal conductance in cpm2 plants was

FIGURE 1 Apparent water use efficiency (WUE) of wild type (WT) and cpm2.
WT& cpm2 plants were subjected to drought after 32 days of sowing by
withholding water. Digital imaging of shoots was performed to estimate green
leaf area which was later normalized by water uptake/day to calculate
apparent WUE. Data is shown for 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25 and 28 days
after imposing drought stress. The values presented are means t standard
error(SE); n = 5. WT and cpm2 are indicated by blue and red lines,
respectively; whereas dotted and solid lines represent control and stress
treatment, respectively. The p-value is indicated as determined by ASReml
analysis. Significance levels are indicated as *P 0.05; ***P < 0.001.
FIGURE 2 Comparison of stomatal conductance of wild type (WT) and cpm2 in (A) control conditions and (B) under drought. Four-week-old WT and cpm2 plants
were exposed to drought stress by withholding water for 4 days followed by re-watering for 2 days. Under control conditions, WT and cpm2 maintained almost
steady state throughout the course of experiment, while cpm2 maintained lower stomatal conductance as compared to WT under drought. The values presented are
means t standard error (SE); n = 5. Blue and red symbols indicate WT and cpm2, respectively. Stars (** and ***) denote statistical significance (P 0.01, and P
0.001), respectively, between the two genotypes in a Student's t-test.

2-fold more than in WT plants (Figure 2B), which were almost
wilting (Figure S2C). After re-watering, water levels in both sets
of plants were replenished. One day after re-watering, cpm2
plants still exhibited higher stomatal conductance compared to
the WT plants. However, stomatal conductance progressively
increased in the WT plants after re-watering, till on day 6 it was
more than that in the cpm2 plants (Figure 2B).
In terms of drought responsive phytohormones, the ABA
content is a measure of drought tolerance (Daszkowska-Golec,
2016; Negin and Moshelion, 2016). Under both the control
and moderate stress conditions (SMC of 30%), ABA content
in the WT shoots was almost double that in cpm2 shoots.
Under severe stress conditions (SMC of 15%), ABA increased
in both cpm2 and WT shoots. However, the increase in ABA
content in cpm2 shoots was almost double that in the WT
shoots (Figure 3A). In case of root ABA content, there were no
significant changes in their levels in both the genotypes under
control and moderate stress, however, during severe stress cpm2
had almost 1.5 fold induction in the ABA content as compared to
the WT (Figure 3B).
As assessed through leaf rolling, WUE, stomatal conductance,
and ABA content, these results clearly demonstrated cpm2 to
have an advantage over WT in coping with drought stress. An
advantageous drought response of the aerial parts suggested that
the roots of cpm2 may also exhibit advantageous features as roots
first sense and react to drought.
The Root System of cpm2 Is Better
Developed
For the WT and cpm2 plants root growth was assessed under
control and drought stress conditions. Nodal root length was
reduced under severe drought by nearly 40% in the WT and
by nearly 50% in cpm2 compared to the control condition
(Figure 4A). Lateral root length was reduced under drought in
