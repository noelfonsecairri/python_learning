Description of databases used in this study, including location of experiments (province), year, nearby weather station, water regime (and season), and dominant crop
sequence and soil textures.
Experiment
Rice-HY
Rice-MLCE
Maize-N experiment
Maize-On-farm fertilizer
trial
a HY: high-yield experiments; MLCE: multi-location cultivar evaluation trial.
b
DS: dry season; WS: wet season.
c
Letters in brackets indicated ecosystem: lowland [L] or upland [U]. Simulated crop cycle is shown in bold; parenthetic third crop appears on a relatively small
fraction of the crop area.
d
Not reported (n.r.) because soil data are not needed for simulation of yield potential for irrigated crops.
e
Number of site-year-seasons per province.
Gridded NASA POWER weather data used for model simulations.

Fig. 1. Location of rice (yellow) and maize
(red) experiments used for model calibration
(rice high-yield [HY] and maize-nitrogen [N]
experiments; stars) and evaluation (rice multi-
location cultivar evaluation [MLCE; triangles]
and on-farm maize fertilizer trials; circles).
Inset shows location of Indonesia within South
East Asia. Province boundaries and names are
shown. (For interpretation of the references to

Fig. 2. Annual patterns of monthly average
maximum (Tmax) and minimum temperature
(Tmin) and total precipitation for two locations
in Java: Sukamandi (West Java; 6.25'S,
107.16E) and Jakenan (Central Java; 6.78'S,
111.20E). Dominant lowland irrigated (solid)
and upland rainfed crop sequences (dashed
lines) are shown for each site and simulated
crop cycles are indicated in bold. Parenthetic
third crop appears on a relatively small frac-
tion of the crop area.
