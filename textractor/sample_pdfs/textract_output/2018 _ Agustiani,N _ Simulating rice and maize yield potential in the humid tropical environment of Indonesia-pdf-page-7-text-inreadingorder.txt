that the generic growth coefficients in Hybrid Maize seem adequate to
reproduce Yp of modern high-yield maize hybrids in Indonesia and,
more broadly, in the tropical humid environments.
3.2. Evaluation of model performance across a wide range of environments
and crop systems
There was large variation in observed yields across site-year-treat-
ments included in the evaluation dataset (Fig. 5). Observed irrigated
rice yield averaged 6.1 Mg ha- ranging from 3.3 to 9.1 Mg ha
Average irrigated and rainfed maize yield was 8.1 and 7.5 Mg ha
respectively, ranging from 0.8 to 13 Mg ha (rainfed) and 0.5 to
13.7 Mg ha (irrigated). Large variation in observed yield was ex-
pected due to differences in weather, soil type, and management across
site-year-treatments. Likewise, many of these experiments may have
experienced nutrient and water deficiencies, incidence of biotic ad-
versities, and other yield-reducing factors such as lodging, sub-
mergence, etc. Indeed, most of the variation in observed maize yields,
for a given level of simulated yield potential, is attributed to differences
in nutrient fertilizer application across treatments.
Examination of observed and simulated yields indicates that, de-
spite the fact that many of these experiments and/or treatments were
not managed to achieve Yp (or Yw), 41% and 39% of the rice and maize
observations, respectively, were above 80% of the simulated Yp (or Yw)
(Fig. 5). Indeed, the simulated yields matched reasonably well the
range of maximum observed yields in both crops. These findings sug-
gest that crops in some site-year-seasons-treatments approached their
Yp and Yw as determined by climate and soil type. There were some
cases with observed yield slightly higher than simulated yields, which
we attributed to measurement error in both yield and weather data, but
we note that only 1% of observed yields exceeded simulated Yp (or Yw)
by more than 10%.

Fig. 5. Model evaluation for rice and maize in Indonesia. Each
datapoint represents a site-year-season-cultivar-treatment combi-
nation, including rainfed (diamonds) and irrigated (circles) crops.
The evaluation database includes the rice MLCE and maize on-
farm fertilizer trials and also the treatments from the rice HY and
maize N-fertilizer experiments that were not used for model cali-
bration (ntotal: 24 and 291 for rice and maize, respectively). The
highest yields at each site-year-season are shown (solid symbols).
Note that data used for model calibration (best treatments in the
rice HY and maize N-fertilizer trials) are shown for comparison
purposes (stars) but not used to compute the values shown in
Table 3. Dashed diagonal line indicates X - y.
Average simulated Yp for rice was 9.1 Mg ha ranging from 6.4 to
12.7 Mg ha across site-years included for the model evaluation
(Table 3). Average Yp and Yw for irrigated and rainfed maize were 11.6
and 11.5 Mg ha-l respectively, ranging from 8.9 to 14.4 Mg ha- (Yp)
and 4.3 to 16.4 Mg ha (Yw). Similarity in irrigated and rainfed maize
simulated yields was not surprising as their corresponding experiments
coincided with the dry and wet seasons, respectively (Fig. 2), except for
one rainfed maize trial conducted during the dry season in North Su-
matra. As expected, variation in Yp across site-year was smaller than for
Yw as indicated by their CVs (12% versus 19%). The range of highest
observed yields, expressed as percentage of their respective Yp (or Yw
for rainfed crops), indicated that, in most cases, the yield achieved by
the best treatments was comparable to the simulated Yp (or Yw) for at
least one site. An exception was the case of rainfed maize in Central
Java where highest observed yields were all well below their corre-
sponding Yw (33-49% of Yw). Rainfed experiments in this province
were located in areas with heavy clay soils (ca. 80% clay content, with
vertic properties which may suggest (i) model inability to reproduce
root dynamics and water balance for this type of soil and/or (ii) diffi-
culties to ensure near-optimal growing conditions over time and space
to overcome unfavorable soil conditions. Likewise, one site in North
Sumatra experienced severe drought and observed yield was clearly
above Yw (% of Yw - 140). We note, however, that the under-
estimation is relatively small in absolute terms (1.5 Mg ha- and this
deviation could be attributed to differences in precipitation between the
