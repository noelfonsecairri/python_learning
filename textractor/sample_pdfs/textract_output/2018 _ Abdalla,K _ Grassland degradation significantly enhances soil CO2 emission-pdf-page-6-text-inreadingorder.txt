0-0.05 m soil layer. Plan lines corresponded to 10th, 25th, median, 75th and 90th percentiles and dashed lines to the mean, N = 9.
(Fig. 8B). In this PCA, SONc content, SOCc and SOCs, aboveground
biomass, C:N ratio and SON stocks correlated negatively to gross CO2
and positively to CO2 relative to SOCs, pointing to the increase of CO2
emissions from soils as the intensity of grassland degradation increases.
4. Discussion
This study results point to a decrease in gross soil CO2 emission
(CO2-C per surface area) as grass cover decreases, meaning that grass
soil CO2 emission decreased with increasing grassland degradation

(Table 1; Fig. 1C), which agreed with findings by other studies such as
Wang et al. (2010), Rey et al. (2011) and Traore et al. (2015). The non-
degraded grassland emitted 11 and 62% more gross CO2 than the
moderately and highly degraded grassland, respectively. This trend can
be explained by decreasing root and microbial respiration, as well as
decreasing fresh organic matter input into the soil (Zhao et al., 2011; Li
et al., 2015) because biomass production decreases with grassland de-
gradation. High grass basal cover and aboveground biomass production
are usually associated with high root biomass (Zhang et al., 2016),
which in turn has significant impact on gross soil CO2 emissions (Raich
