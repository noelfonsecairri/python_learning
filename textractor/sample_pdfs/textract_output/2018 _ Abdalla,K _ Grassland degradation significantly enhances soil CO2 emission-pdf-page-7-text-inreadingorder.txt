Tufekciogul (2000), and Wanga et al. (2005) reported that root re-
spiration contributes between 38 and 78% of total soil CO2 emissions.

The decrease of gross soil CO2 emission with grassland degradation
also coincided with decreasing SOCs (Fig. 4), which pointed to sig-
nificant contributions of soil C to gross soil CO2 emissions (r = 0.82 and
0.83 for SOCc and SOCs, respectively) (Table 2). In addition, higher soil
C stimulates higher microbial activity with, as reported by Whitaker
et al. (2014), in a study conducted along the Andes-to-Amazon eleva-
tion gradient, increased soil respiration The positive correlation be-
tween grassland degradation and soil clay content can be explained by
the outcropping of deep clayey horizons to the soil surface thus leading
a greater top-soil clay content. Such an increase in soil clay content
might improve carbon protection thus depressing gross soil CO2 emis-
sion (Traore et al., 2015). Traore et al. (2015) reported decreasing soil
CO2 emission with increasing soil clay content in a semi-arid climate of
West Africa, which the authors attributed to the improved physical
protection of soil C by clay materials. However, Li et al. (2015) reported
significantly positive correlation between soil CO2 emission and clay
content in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, which contradicts the
current result.
Other factors such as soil bulk density, which Chaplot et al. (2015)
showed to significantly decrease soil CO2 emissions under a maize
production system, appeared to have no significant effect on soil CO2
emission in the current study. However, top-soil C:N ratio correlated
positively with gross soil CO2 emission, which agreed with findings by
several previous studies (e.g. Whitaker et al., 2014; Spohn, 2015;
Abdalla et al., 2016). Spohn (2015) explained such positive correlation
in terms of three microbial mechanisms; nitrogen mining, overflow
respiration, and enzyme inhibition.
Soil CO2 emissions relative to SOCs were 41 and 15% higher in
moderately and highly degraded grassland, respectively, than non-de-
graded grassland (Table 1 and Fig. 2), which suggested decreasing soil
C protection with increasing grassland degradation. Decreasing soil C
protection with land degradation can be explained by weakening soil
structure and lower aggregate stability (Mchunu and Chaplot, 2012;
Chaplot and Cooper, 2015). Weaker soil aggregates offer less protection
to the entrapped carbon against decomposers (Six et al., 2002), which
facilitates faster decomposition of soil organic materials. Surprisingly,
highly degraded grassland emitted significantly lower soil CO2 relative
to SOCs than the moderately degraded grassland (Table 1), which CO-
incided with significantly lower soil temperature and water content
