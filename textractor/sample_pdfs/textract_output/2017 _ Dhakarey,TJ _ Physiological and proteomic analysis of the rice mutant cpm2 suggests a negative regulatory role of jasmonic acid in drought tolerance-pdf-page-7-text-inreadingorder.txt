FIGURE 4 Comparative differences were observed in root architecture in wild type (WT) and cpm2. Plants of two genotypes were grown in soils at different moisture
levels. Roots were harvested, washed and stored in 75% ethanol until scanning and analysis. Significant differences were observed across the treatments. Values for

basis of DAPs that can potentially modify or affect the cell
wall structure, composition or properties (Table 1). In cpm2
there was an increased content of six major enzymes of the
phenylpropanoid pathway involving cinnamic acid modification,
which potentially modify the cell wall composition. The enzymes
involved suggest variation in coumaric and ferulic acid content
(Figure S5), which was confirmed by the quantification of the
coumaric and ferulic acid ester-linked to cell wall biopolymers in
the roots. Ester-linked coumaric and ferulic acid contents were
both significantly lower in cpm2 compared to the WT under
drought (Figures 7A,B). This agreed with the increased content
of the enzymes that used the two acids as substrates in cpm2.
The levels of ester-linked di-, tri- and total oligo-ferulates were
also generally lower in the roots of cpm2 under drought but
significantly so for the measured triferulates (Figure S6C). Under
control conditions, there was no significant difference between
WT and cpm2 in the content of coumaric or ferulic acid or
ferulate oligomers (Figure 7, Figure S6).

Higher WUE and Stomatal Conductance in
The observation of higher WUE and higher stomatal
conductance in cpm2 is somewhat antagonistic. Genotypes
bearing higher stomatal conductance may indicate a pronounced
capability of uptaking available soil water through enhanced
root area (Mitchell et al. 1996) or osmotic adjustment (Blum
2005), and thereby, can maintain transpiration during moderate
drought stress (Blum, 2009) But on the other hand, enhanced
stomatal conductance might be a downside when soil water
deficits are more common (Donovan et al., 2007). Plants counter
severe water deficit by decreasing their stomatal conductance,
however by a curtailment of WUE, plants could deplete available
water quickly and consequently die by loss of turgor, if they fail in
a drought survival strategy (Donovan et al., 2007; Manzoni et al.,
2011). In the case of our study, the higher stomatal conductance
