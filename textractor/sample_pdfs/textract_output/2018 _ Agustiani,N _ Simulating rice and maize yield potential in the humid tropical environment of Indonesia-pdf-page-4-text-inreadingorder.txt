(MLCE) trial (Fig. Table 1). Experiments were located at 17 sites
across Java Island; the latter accounts for 46% of rice area in Indonesia
(https://www.bps.go.id). In all cases, rice seedlings were transplanted
ca. 21 days after sowing (DAS), with 2-3 seedlings per hill. Fields re-
ceived adequate water supply, with water depth maintained at ca. 5 cm
during the entire crop season. Rice yields were determined from a
sample (size: 6.25-12 m2) collected from the center of each plot at
harvest maturity. Reported yields correspond to paddy rice adjusted to
14% grain moisture content. Annual patterns of temperature and pre-
cipitation are shown for two representative locations in Java (Fig. 2).
The HY experiments were conducted at three sites in west Java:
Subang (6.624'S; 107.746E), Indramayu (-6.518'S, 108.291E), and
Bandung (-7.011"S, 107.746E) Experiments were conducted during
the dry season (April-September) in 2016 (Fig. 1). Experiments fol-
lowed a randomized complete block design with four replicates (plot
size: m2) and included two plant density treatments (16 and 21 hills
The same variety (Inpari 32) was grown across experiments.
Inpari 32 is a new high-yielding inbred variety (parental lines: Ciherang
and IRBB64), which is becoming one of the predominant varieties
across major producing rice areas in Indonesia, replacing old varieties
such as Ciherang, Dodokan, and Silugonggo. Periodic applications of
pesticides and manual weeding kept crops free of weeds, diseases, and
insect pests during the entire growing season. Total applied fertilizer
was 126 (nitrogen [N]), 11 (phosphorous [P]), and 25 (potassium [K])
kg hal, with fertilizer amounts determined based on soil tests and es-
timated requirements to achieve yields near Yp at each site. N fertilizer
was split in three applications (ca. 7, 24, and 42 days after transplanting
[DAT]). Destructive plant samples were taken at early vegetative (7
DAT), 10% flowering (67 DAT), and physiological maturity (112 DAT)
stages to determine leaf area and dry matter per plant organ (stems,
leaves, and panicles)
The MLCE trials were conducted in 13 irrigated farmer fields over
seven years (2010-2016), including both wet (October to March) and
dry (April to September) seasons, representing a total of 24 site-year-
season combinations (Table 1). These trials followed a complete ran-
domized design, with three replicates (plot size: m2). Same plant
density was used across experiments (16 hills m The goal of these
trials was to evaluate performance of commercially available rice
inbred varieties, including new (Inpari 10, 13, 18, 23, 28, and 33) and
old varieties (Ciherang, Dodokan, and Silugonggo). Cultivars varied
across site-year-seasons, but there were at least 3 varieties per trial.
Crops were not necessarily managed with an aim to reach Yp; instead,
fertilizer amounts and management practices were guided by local re-
commendations. Total applied fertilizer ranged from 115 to 140 (N), 7
to 16 (P), and 25 to 50 (K) kg ha-l site-year-seasons.
2.2.2. Maize experimental data
Data on maize yield and phenology (dates of silking and physiolo-
gical maturity) were available from on-farm (NPK) fertilizer trials
conducted for hybrid maize across major producing regions in
Indonesia during 2004-2007 (Table 1, Fig. 1). In each region, on-farm
experiments were conducted in at least five farmer fields, totaling 59
site-year combinations. Additionally, we used data from a replicated N
fertilizer experiment conducted during the dry season in 2005, 2006,
2008 and 2009 at the Indonesian Cereal Research Institute at Maros,
South Sulawesi. Hybrids varied across experiments but represented
commercially available modern hybrids grown across Indonesia, in-
cluding Pioneer 21, Pioneer 12, Bisi 2, and Bima 1. Soil and agronomic
data were collected for each field and treatment. Experiments were
scouted every 11-13 days to determine phenological stage. Grain yield
was determined from 1 to 2 samples taken from the center of each plot
after physiological maturity. All yields reported here correspond to
grain yield (without cob) at 15.5% grain moisture content. Detailed
description of these experiments can be found elsewhere (Witt et al.,
2006; Pasuquin et al., 2012, 2014).
On-farm fertilizer trials included the following treatment plots: (i)
European Journal of Agronomy 101 (2018) 10-19
omission plots to which no fertilizer N, P, or K were applied, (ii) fully
(NPK) fertilized plot that received 150-200 N ha 35-52 P
and 75-100 K ha (iii) a site-specific nutrient management
(SSNM) treatment, and (iv) a farmer fertilizer practice (FFP) treatment,
in which farmers made all decisions in regards with crop and fertilizer
management practices without interference from researchers.
Treatment plots were managed to ameliorate incidence of other yield-
limiting factors, which included changes in plant density, manure or
lime application, and better control of weed, insect pests, and diseases.
Fields were rainfed or irrigated depending on the dominant water re-
gime at each location. Experiments conducted in South Sulawesi during
2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009 followed a split plot design, with four
replicates. Main plots correspond to different N fertilizer amounts (0,
75, 150, and 225 and subplots to different combinations of
number and timing of splits dressings. Experiment conducted during
2006 had also two plant populations (7.3 and Large rates (kg
of fertilizer P (17) and K fertilizer (90-125) were applied to
ensure that P and K were not limiting. Plots were irrigated as necessary
to maintain adequate soil moisture during the entire crop season and
We followed two steps for calibrating and evaluating ORYZA and
Hybrid Maize in Indonesia: (i) calibration of phenological (Hybrid
Maize and ORYZA) and growth-related (ORYZA) parameters, and (ii)
evaluation of calibrated models by comparison of simulated yields
versus highest observed yields in variety and fertilizer trials. We cali-
brated model parameters for Inpari 32 (rice) and Pioneer 21 (maize)
because these two cultivars were included in the majority of site-years
included in the database. These are commercial, broadly adapted cul-
tivars, with good pest resistance and 90-130 days growth duration, and
widely grown across all major rice and maize producing areas in
Indonesia. We did not attempt to calibrate coefficients for hybrid rice as
current adoption is still very low 1% of harvested rice area in
Indonesia). Model simulations assumed non-water limited conditions
for simulation of Yp for irrigated rice and maize, while water limitation
was accounted for in the simulation of Yw for rainfed maize, irrespec-
tive if crops were grown during the dry or wet seasons. Yp is expected to
be higher in the dry versus wet season due to higher solar radiation
levels, while Yw is typically higher during the wet season as a result of
abundant in-season precipitation. In all cases, simulations assumed no
nutrient limitations and no yield reductions due to biotic factors such as
In the case of rice, we used data from the high-density treatment in
the HY experiments (yield range: 7.8-10 Mg to calibrate pheno-
logical and growth-related coefficients for Inpari 32. In the case of
Hybrid Maize, it only requires calibration of GDD from emergence to
physiological maturity. We used data from the treatment that received
the largest N fertilizer application (ca. 225 in the N-fertilizer
experiment (yield range: 12-14.4 to derive the GDD for
Pioneer 21 and also to evaluate the robustness of Hybrid Maize generic
growth coefficients at simulating the observed yields. In both (HY and
N-fertilizer) experiments, crops were maintained fully irrigated during
the entire crop season and received management practices that were
For ORYZA, we calibrated the model on 'experiment' mode in order
to reproduce the observed values. Two optimization programs (DRATES
and PARAM) were used for calibrating model ORYZA coefficients re-
lated with phenology and crop growth (Li et al., 2017). Subsequently,
the AutoCalibration tool was iterated ca. 7000 times to minimize de-
viation between simulated outputs and observed values and derive the
final values for the coefficients. Following previous studies on rice
modelling (Bouman et al., 2001; Li et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2017),
crops were kept free of weed, diseases, and insect pests.
