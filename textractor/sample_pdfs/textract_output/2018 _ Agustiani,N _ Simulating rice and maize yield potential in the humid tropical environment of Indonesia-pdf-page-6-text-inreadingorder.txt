Fig. 3. Comparison between observed and simulated rice total aboveground dry matter (left), stem dry matter (center), and leaf area index (right) at early vegetative
(yellow), flowering (green), and physiological maturity stage (red). Coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalized
square error (RMSEn, in %) are shown (encircled data point in left panel was excluded for their calculation because of water stress during grain filling at this site)
Dashed diagonal line indicates X = y. Data were collected from high-yield irrigated experiments conducted at three sites (Subang, Indramayu, and Bandung). (For

3. Results
3.1. Derivation of model coefficients using data from high-yielding
experiments
Calibrated coefficients for the rice (Inpari 32) and maize (Pioneer
21) cultivars are shown in Table 2. These coefficients were estimated
using data from high-yield rice and maize experiments that were likely
to approach near-optimal growing conditions that allow expression of
Yp (and Yw).
Fig. 3 shows a comparison between observed total aboveground dry
matter, stem weight, and LAI at different crop stages (early vegetative,
flowering, and physiological maturity) against simulated values using
the calibrated coefficients. In general, there was reasonably good
agreement between simulated and observed values for all parameters
without a detectable bias across locations and crop stages
(RMSEn E 23%; r2 > 0.93, after exclusion of one observation). RMSE
values for aboveground biomass (1.6 Mg ha-1), stem dry matter
(0.7 Mg ha and leaf area index (0.5) was similar to their average
observed experimental standard deviation (1.1 Mg ha 0.6 Mg ha
and 0.2, respectively). An exception was the overestimation in total
aboveground dry matter at maturity at the site located at high elevation
(Bandung). Water supply was limiting during grain filling at that site
leading to crop water stress, which explains the discrepancy between
simulated and observed values at late reproductive stages. Overall, the
calibrated coefficients were robust at reproducing crop growth and
partitioning for this high-yielding rice variety.
In the case of maize, GDD derived for Pioneer 21 from the N ferti-
lizer experiment (1821Cd 95th confidence interval: 1799 to 1843'Cd)
was similar to those derived for the same hybrid based using the data
from the on-farm fertilizer trials (average: 1786'Cd confidence in-
terval: 1657 to 1915'Cd). T-test indicated that the difference between
GDDs derived from the two databases did not deviate significantly from
the null hypothesis of zero (p = 0.64). That finding implicitly shows
that the model was robust at reproducing observed dates of silking and
physiological maturity in the evaluation database. Across site-years
(including all experiments), coefficient of variation for GDD for Pioneer
21 was 13%, indicating that GDD were stable irrespective of the bio-
physical environment. Analysis of on-farm maize trials indicated that
Bisi 2, another widespread maize hybrid in Indonesia, had similar,
though slightly less (5%), GDD to Pioneer 21. To summarize, the GDD
derived from the two trials indicate that our estimate of GDD for
Pioneer 21 can be considered as representative for commercial maize
hybrids in Indonesia and stable across site-years.

The treatments that received large NPK fertilizer amounts in the
irrigated N-fertilizer experiment provided a near-stress free environ-
ment where it was possible to evaluate the performance of the generic
growth parameters in Hybrid Maize. As mentioned previously, these
coefficients had originally been derived for temperate hybrids but never
validated for tropical maize. Fig. 4 shows the observed yields and as-
sociated simulated Yp using site-specific weather and reported dates of
sowing and physiological maturity. Observed maize yields were very
high, ranging from 11.2 to 15.3 Mg ha across years (excluding the
low density treatment), with very low inter-annual CV (7%). Re-
markably, Hybrid Maize reproduced very well the high yields measured
in those experiments and response to plant density, with RMSE of
1.2 Mg ha (9% of observed mean), which was, in turn, similar to
observed standard deviation in these experiments (average: 1.4 Mg
ha equivalent to 11% of the observed mean). Confidence intervals
ranged from 12.2 to 13.7 Mg ha -1 and 12.1 to 13.5 Mg ha for observed
and simulated yields, respectively, with paired t-test indicating that the
difference between observed and simulated yields did not deviate sig-
nificantly from zero (p E 0.75). Observed yields were within + 10% of
Yp in all cases but one (15% higher in 2008). This analysis indicates
