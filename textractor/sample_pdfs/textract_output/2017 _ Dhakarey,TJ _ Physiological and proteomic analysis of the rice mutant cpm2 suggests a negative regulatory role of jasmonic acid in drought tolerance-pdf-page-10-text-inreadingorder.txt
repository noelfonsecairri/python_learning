GS enhances drought and salinity tolerance (Kalamaki et al.,
2009).
DAPs-Mediated Changes in Root Cell Walls Suggests
More Active Root Development in cpm2
Roots quickly respond to changes in water potential and
significantly alter morpho-physiological traits (Henry et al., 2012;
Sandhu et al., 2016) Several DAPs such as a glycoside hydrolase
(GH; family 17), O-methyl transferase (OMT), UDP-D-Glucose
dehydrogenase, tubulin, and actin nucleation protein (Figure 8)
suggested the ability of cpm2 roots to stimulate cell wall
adaptations during drought. GH17 endohydrolases cleave 1,3-D-
glucosidic linkages linking B-1,3-glucans and therefore affect cell-
wall assembly and rearrangement. GH17 endohydrolase activity
has been linked with improved performance of rice plants under

stress conditions such as, mechanical wounding or fungal stress
(Jwa et al., 2006). The GH17 endohydrolase as a DAP was
more abundant in cpm2 (Figure 8). Similarly, an OMT was
more abundant in cpm2 (Figure 8). It is evident that OMTs
may participate in several biotic and abiotic stress responses
(Barakat et al., 2011). Being multifunctional enzymes, OMTs
are reportedly known to play diverse role in various processes
such as cell wall adaptation and catalyzing O-methylation of
multiple secondary metabolites that are known participants
during metabolic processes like plant growth, development,
and environmental cues (Kim et al., 2010; Urbanowicz et al.,
2012) A UDP-D-glucose dehydrogenase (UDPGDH) was also
present in larger amount in cpm2 (Figure 8). UDPGDH oxidizes
UDP-D-glucose (UDP-GIc) to UDP-D-glucuronate (UDP-GIcA)

the precursors of arabinoxylans, the major hemicellulosic
