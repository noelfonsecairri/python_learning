FIGURE 4 Comparative differences were observed in root architecture in wild type (WT) and cpm2. Plants of two genotypes were grown in soils at different moisture
levels. Roots were harvested, washed and stored in 75% ethanol until scanning and analysis. Significant differences were observed across the treatments. Values for
