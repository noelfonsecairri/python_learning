INTRODUCTION
Rice serves as the staple food for more than 50% of world's
population. It is cultivated in over a hundred countries, with a
tota harvested area of 163.3 million hectares, with a produce of
more than 749.7 million tons annually (GRiSP, 2013; FAO, 2016).
In comparison to other crops, rice production is highly water-
intensive and almost 30.9% of the total rice area of the world is
through rainfed agriculture (Wassmann et al., 2009; Dixit et al.,
2014). As per an estimate, nearly 2,500 liters of water is needed
to give rise to kg of rice, and irrigated rice consumes around
34-43% of the world's total irrigation water (Bouman et al., 2007).
Hence water deficit or drought is said to be the most calamitous
form of abiotic stress for rice and can result in yield losses of 15-
50%, depending on the severity and timing of stress (Srividhya
et al., 2011). Globally, drought stress leads to an estimated 18
million tons of rice yield reduction per year (O'Toole, 2004)
Drought stress affects rice during all growth stages
(Venuprasad et al., 2008). Development of drought-
tolerant, higher-yielding varieties suitable for water-limiting
environments is a major challenge for improvement of rice
production and in turn for increasing food security. The
development of such varieties can be fast-tracked through
the knowledge of the physiological and molecular genetic
mechanisms underpinning drought tolerance.
Growth regulators also known as phytohormones orchestrate
plant responses to growth, development, and external stimuli
(Wolters and Jurgens, 2009). These compounds are synthesized
through various biosynthetic processes and can function either at
the site of their genesis or be translocated to function somewhere
else in the plant. They often quickly modify gene expression
by instigating or blocking the degradation of transcriptional
regulators via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Santner and
Estelle, 2010) Abscisic acid signaling and ABA-
responsive genes is one of the most investigated hormonal
responses of plants to abiotic stress, especially in drought (Tuteja,
2007; Sreenivasulu et al., 2012). The role of ABA in the regulation
of stomata opening/closure and other critical responses to abiotic
stress is quite established (Mittler and Blumwald, 2015). Drought
and other stresses such as, salinity result in an increased content
of ABA, which orchestrates extensive changes in the expression
of genes regulated by or responsive to ABA (Shinozaki and
Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007). However, such a change in a single
phytohormonal pathway usually affects other phytohormonal
pathways as well, and the resulting crosstalk contributes to
the overall response of plant to abiotic stress (Kohli et al.,
2013). Jasmonates (i.e., jasmonic acid, its precursors, and direct
derivatives) are critical components of such crosstalk (Riemann
et al., 2015).
The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) and its metabolically
active derivatives like methyl-jasmonate and JA-Isoleucine (JA-
Ile) are crucial signaling molecules, which actively engage in plant
responses to various biotic as well as abiotic stresses (Wasternack,
2007; Balbi and Devoto, 2008) In the JA biosynthesis pathway,
plastidial 13-lipoxygenases (13-LOX) act on linolenic acid to
convert it to 13S-hydroperoxyoctadecatrienoic acid (13-HPOT).

act in combination to synthesize cis-12-oxophytodienoic acid
(OPDA). OPDA is then transported into peroxisomes where it is
reduced by OPDA reductase (OPR) Subsequently it is converted
into JA by three B-oxidation steps (Wasternack and Hause, 2013)
An important step in jasmonate biosynthesis is regulated by
AOC, which is encoded by a four membered small gene family
in Arabidopsis thaliana. In A. thaliana, AOC functions as homo-
or hetero-trimer (Hofmann et al., 2006; Stenzel et al., 2012; Otto
et al., 2016). In rice, however, this enzyme is encoded by a single
copy gene (Dhakarey et al., 2016).
There is limited information on the role of jasmonates in the
response of rice to drought (Liu et al., 2015; Riemann et al.,
2015; Dhakarey et al., 2016). In this report, a JA synthesis
mutant called coleoptile photomorphogenesis 2 (cpm2) was used
to understand the role of JA on rice physiological and molecular
responses to drought. It carries an 11 bp deletion within the
first exon of AOC (Riemann et al., 2013; Dhakarey et al.,
2016). Comparative studies between the WT and the mutant for
differences in drought response were undertaken at the vegetative
growth stage, since cpm2 is male sterile. Assessment of drought
response was conducted on a set of morphological parameters
and root proteome. The differentially abundant proteins (DAPs)
in the root proteome study were related to various pathways
and processes. Additional histological and metabolite analysis
guided by the DAPs supported the observation that cpm2 was
better adapted to cope with drought stress. This leads to the
proposition that jasmonates might be negative regulators of
drought tolerance.

Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica CV. Nihonmasari serving as the
wild type (WT) and the cpm2, the JA biosynthesis mutant
generated in the same background (Riemann et al., 2013), were
used in this whole study. Dehusked caryopses were surface
sterilized as per Hazman et al. (2015), were then sown on 0.5%
phytoagar medium (Duchefa, Netherlands) and kept for 14 days
in a culture room at 250C and continuous light of 120 umol
quanta -2s-1 On the 14th day, 10 selected seedlings of each
genotype were transferred in sand filled pots, kept for another
2 weeks under short-day conditions of 10h light at 28C and
280 umol quanta m-2s-1, followed by 14h darkness at 220C
in a phytochamber (BBC York, Mannheim, Germany). Plants
were kept well-watered and provided once a week with fertilizers
