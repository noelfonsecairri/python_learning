FIGURE 6 I Effect of drought on enzymes involved in JA biosynthesis and their transcript levels. (A) Overview of the jasmonic acid pathway with log ratios
(stress/control) for AOC and OPR7protein are shown in boxes, respectively. Transcript abundances of mRNAs encoding (B) AOC and (C) OPR7 protein were analyzed
at control, moderate and severe drought stress conditions. Wild type (WT) and cpm2 are represented by blue and red bars, respectively. Data represents mean value

(He et al., 2009). Glucosinolates act by inducing antioxidative
enzymes such as GSTs (Vig et al., 2009). The 3-IPMD was
classified as an antioxidant upregulated by JA (Sasaki-Sekimoto
et al., 2005) Yet it is present in larger amount in cpm2 which lacks
JA. Amongst the redox category, non-symbiotic hemoglobin2
(nSHb2) was the only protein reported to be less abundant in
cpm2 (Figure 8). Limited information is available about this
class of protein or its probable function under abiotic stress,
but it is known to be upregulated under hypoxia in plant roots
(Riquelme and Hinrichsen, 2015). A positive correlation was
established between nSHb2 and the amount of w-3 a-linolenic
acid, a precursor of JA, in the Arabidopsis seeds (Vigeolas et al.,
2011) It cannot be said at this stage if the lack of JA in cpm2 was
a reason for reduced levels of nSHb2 under drought.
DAPs in Energy-Generating Carbon/Nitrogen
Catabolism Indicates Higher Resource Mobilization
in cpm2
Glycolysis is a major metabolic pathway participating in
carbohydrate metabolism, and drought stress triggers altered
amino acid and sugar contents (Raorane et al., 2015b,a). In
cpm2, three DAPs related to carbon catabolism were more
abundant; triose phosphate isomerase (TPI), glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD) and pyruvate decarboxylase

(PDC) (Figure 8). G3PD may serve as a direct link relating
energy metabolism, membrane lipid-based signaling and control
of a plant's growth in response to ROS and water stress
(Guo et al., 2012). TPI is reported to participate in plant
stress response and under drought stress, its expression is
also induced in maize (Riccardi et al., 1998). Being the first
and key participating enzyme during ethanolic fermentation,
pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) splits the main glycolytic pathway
at pyruvate (Zabalza et al., 2009). Ethanolic fermentation is
reported to occur not only under anaerobic conditions but also
under stress conditions (Chen and Han, 2011) Similarly, some
protein catabolism-related enzymes specific to proteasomes, such
as, the threonine proteases T1-family peptidases, were more
abundant in cpm2 (Figure 8). Increased proteasome activity
under stress is related to degradation of oxidized proteins, thus
contributing to tolerance of oxidative stress (Kurepa et al., 2009).
Protein degradation feeds into a favorable nitrogen status of the
roots under drought (Kohli et al., 2012). A favorable nitrogen
status of cpm2 under drought was also supported by more
abundance of Glutamine Synthetase (Figure 8). Serving as the
first enzyme in the nitrogen assimilatory pathway, GS is known
to regulate nitrogen metabolism and plant productivity (Lea
and Miflin, 2011) and has been shown to be upregulated at
the transcript and protein level under drought in rice (Raorane
