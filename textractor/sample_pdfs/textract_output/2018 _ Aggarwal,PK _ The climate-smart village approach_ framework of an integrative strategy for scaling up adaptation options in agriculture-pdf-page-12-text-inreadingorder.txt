adaptation strategies do not become maladaptive. The role of an
appropriate monitoring and evaluation framework and indicators
of climate smartness that can be easily measured becomes very
important.
It is important that agriculture in developing countries should be
resilient to climatic risks as well as increase production to meet
increasing food demands. This paper has presented a scalable
approach that integrates agronomic interventions, climate
information services, and farmers' traditional knowledge at local
scales. The components contribute to both resilience and
mitigation The CSV approach can be scaled out horizontally and
locally through farmer participatory processes and farmer-to-
farmer communication. With appropriate institutional support,
a CSA portfolio can be scaled out to large numbers of farmers
and thus address national food security, adaptation, and
mitigation goals. The CSV approach also brings science into
farming practice and combines development goals with action-
based research. The CSV is an "eco-regional" approach
(Rabbinge 1995) that links bottom-up farming system research
with environmental issues, livelihoods, and socioeconomics and
connects knowledge generation to policy processes. It is unique
in the sense that it provides an AR4D platform for
multistakeholder participatory evaluation of CSA options and
links global and local knowledge with local and national policies,
thus presenting a holistic vision for sustainable agricultural
development as well as confronting climate change action in
agriculture. Although evidence for this is still being accumulated,
the monitoring and evaluation framework linked to the baselines
already collected will establish this in future years.
