default values derived from IR64 and IR72 cultivars were used for the
two parameters associated with photoperiod influence on phenology
(photoperiod sensitivity and maximum optimum photoperiod
[11.5h]). Measured and observed values of total dry matter (WAGT),
panicle weight (WSO), stem weight (WST), leaf weight (WLVG), and
LAI were compared to evaluate the robustness of the calibrated growth-
related coefficients for ORYZA. In the case of maize, GDDs were cal-
culated as the sum of daily mean temperature (after subtracting a base
temperature of 8'C) between reported dates of sowing to physiological
maturity for each experiment.
Agreement between simulated and observed variables was assessed
with the coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error
(RMSE), and normalized RMSE (RMSEn):
RMSE (s-0)2/n)]0.5

where S (or y) and O (or x) are the simulated and observed values,
respectively, and n is the number of paired values. Small RMSEn and
high r2 indicate good agreement between simulated and observed va-
lues. Following Gaydon et al. (2017), RMSE was also compared with the
observed standard deviation, as estimated from the replicates of each
treatment in each experiment, to assess the degree of agreement be-
tween observed and simulated values relative to experimental data
uncertainty.
2.3.2. Model evaluation
The second step (i.e., model evaluation) consisted of comparing si-
mulated versus observed yields to evaluate model ability to reproduce
Yp (maize and rice) and Yw (maize). We used the MLCE rice trials
(range: 3.6-9.1 Mg and on-farm maize trials (range: 0.5-13.7 Mg
ha-l) to evaluate ORYZA and Hybrid Maize using the calibrated coef-
ficients. We also included the low-density treatments from the (rice) HY
experiments and the other treatments included in the N-fertilizer ex-
periment to the evaluation dataset (these treatments were not used for
model calibration so they can be treated as independent from the ca-
libration dataset). All together, these experiments portrayed the range
of climate, soils, and cropping systems in Indonesia.
We acknowledge that the maize and rice databases used for the
evaluation included experiments that were not designed to eliminate all
yield-limiting factors. Hence, it was expected that a well-calibrated
model would predict Yp (or Yw) values greater than observed yields in
most cases, consistent with previous studies attempting to quantify Yp
or Yw for other crops (Cassman, 1999; Lobell et al., 2009). Still, it can
be expected that simulated Yp (or Yw) will be less than observed yields
at some sites due to sampling variability and measurement error in both
yield and weather data, though these cases should be a minority for a
model that simulate Yp (or Yw) well. To benchmark the performance of
our calibrated models at reproducing Yp and Yw, we selected the
treatment with highest yield at each site-year-season experiment. The
assumption was that some of these highest yields would approach Yp
(or Yw) for that environment. Other previous modeling studies have
followed a similar approach to evaluate crop model performance in
absence of experimental data from crops that were explicitly managed
to reach Yp or Yw (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2014; Espe et al., 2016;
Rattalino Edreira et al., 2017). Finally, we used phenology data from
the on-farm fertilizer trials to evaluate the degree to which GDD derived
for Pioneer 21 were robust at predicting phenology across other sites,
years, seasons, and hybrids.

2.3.3. Sources of weather, soil, and management data and initial conditions
For both model calibration and evaluation, we used reported dates
of sowing (or transplanting) and plant density, and site-specific soil
type (for Yw simulations) and daily weather data, including solar ra-
diation, Tmax, Tmin humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For the
MLCE trial, Yp was simulated using the coefficients calibrated for Inpari
32; in the case of the on-farm maize trial, we used the reported dates of
sowing and physiological maturity. Measured daily weather data from
nearest meteorological station to each experimental site were retrieved
from the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical
Agency (BMKG; http://www.bmkg.go.id/) (Table 1). Quality control
and filling and/or correction of the weather data was performed based
on correlations between the target station and one to three adjacent
weather stations following the methodology described by van Wart
et al. (2013) and references cited therein. Number of corrected and/or
filled data was always lower than 3% for all variables. We used data
from a total of 14 meteorological stations. No nearby weather station
was available for the experimental sites near Sragen (Central Java) and
Jeneponto (South Sulawesi); hence, we used gridded weather data from
the Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource dataset from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA-POWER; NASA, 2012).
Pedo-transfer functions for tropical soils were used to derive the upper
and lower soil water retention limits for simulation of Yw for rainfed
maize based on the soil texture reported at each site (Hodnett and
Tomasella, 2002; Rustanto et al., 2017). Given the lack of information
on soil rootable depth, we assumed a 1.5 m soil depth for all site-years,
which would be the typical maize rootable depth in a soil without
chemical and physical constrains to root growth (Dardanelli et al.,
1997; Tolk et al., 2016; Ordonez et al., 2018). Sensitivity analysis for
maize indicated that Yw would be slightly (7%) smaller if a shallow soil
depth m) would have been chosen for the simulations. In rainfed
sites, the soil water balance was initiated near harvest time of the
preceding crop using a fixed soil water content, which was obtained
from expert opinion and/or simulation of water balance for the pre-
Calibrated coefficients for Inpari 32 (rice) and Pioneer 21 (maize) based on data
