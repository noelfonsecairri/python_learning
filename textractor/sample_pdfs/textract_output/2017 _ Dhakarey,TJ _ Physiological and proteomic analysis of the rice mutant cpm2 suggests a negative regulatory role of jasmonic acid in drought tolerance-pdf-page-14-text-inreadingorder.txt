AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS
RD performed the morpho-physiological characterization
experiments, generated all plant sampling material, prepared
RNA and protein samples, performed TMT labeling experiments,
analyzed and interpreted the morpho-physiological, cell wall
metabolite and root proteome results, and wrote the manuscript;
MLR helped in sampling plant materials, performed transcript
analysis of AOC and OPR7, interpreted the proteome and
metabolite data and participated in writing the manuscript.
AT performed the LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis for
the root proteomics data. PP performed the gRT-PCR analysis
of genes related to phenylpropanoid pathway. RS and MB
performed the cell wall metabolite analysis and its interpretation,
respectively. VS performed the root histological studies. BH
performed the plant hormone measurements and participated
in manuscript writing. AH designed and supervised the
physiological experiments and participated in interpreting the
morpho-physiological data. AK and MR together conceptualized
and supervised the whole study as well as participated in writing
the manuscript.
