infiltration by water. Reduced infiltration, in turn, induces and soil C
erosion (Mchunu and Chaplot, 2012), which reduces soil organic
carbon stocks (SOCs) (Dlamini et al., 2014), water content (Yi et al.,
2012) and soil temperature (Mills and Fey, 2004).
Several studies have extensively investigated the impact of grass-
land degradation on sOC stocks (SOCs). For instance, Dlamini et al.
(2016) in a meta-analysis of 131 comparative studies worldwide
showed that grassland degradation reduces SOCs by an average 9%,
with 16 and 8% reductions in dry and wet climates, respectively. Dong
et al. (2012) also reported significant decline (33%) of SOC with in-
creasing degradation in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China. In ad-
dition, Dlamini et al. (2014) reported SOCs loss of as much as 89%
following degradation of grassland in the sub-tropical climate of South
Africa. While these studies and numerous others reported on the im-
pacts of grassland degradation on SOCs, there are very few studies re-
porting on the consequences on soil CO2 emissions. For example, Rey
et al. (2011) reported 25% higher soil CO2 emissions from non-de-
graded than degraded grasslands in Southeastern Spain. Traore et al.
(2015) reported as much as 82% higher soil CO2 emissions from non-
degraded than degraded grasslands in semi-arid West Africa. In con-
trast, some studies reported more soil CO2 emissions from degraded
than non-degraded grasslands (Cao et al., 2004; Li et al., 2015; Chen
et al., 2016). For example, Chen et al. (2016) reported 23.6% more
annual CO2 fluxes from degraded than non-degraded soils. Li et al.
(2015) reported similar findings, which they explained to be a result of
higher soil temperatures leading to greater C mineralization. The con-
tradicting results on the impact of grassland degradation on soil CO2
emissions might require further appraisal. Work is also still required to
inform on the impacts of grassland degradation on soil CO2 emission
relative to SOCs and biomass production. The CO2 emission relative to
SOCs and biomass produced could serve as indirect means of evaluating
soC stability and the economic use of C by grasslands, respectively,
which are further indicators of ecosystem functioning. In addition,
knowledge on the factors controlling soil CO2 emissions following
grassland degradation is important during formulation of strategies to
minimize soil CO2 emissions by maximizing soil C protection and/or
sequestration, and biomass production. Therefore, the present study
performed on a grassland in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, aimed to
assess soil CO2 emission as a function of grass basal cover, SOCs, grass
production and a series of environmental and soil properties. The study
hypothesis was that low basal cover increases soil temperature, which
in turn enhances soil C mineralization to yield higher soil CO2 emission
than under non-degraded grasslands.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
The experiment was conducted at Potshini (29 21' E, 28 48' S;
altitude range 1080-1455 masl), located 10 km south of Bergville town
in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. The area experiences a tem-
perate climate characterised by warm wet summers and cool dry win-
ters. The long-term years) mean annual temperature and pre-
cipitation of the study area are 13 C and 684 mm, respectively (Dlamini
et al., 2011). Moist Highveld Sourveld dominated the native vegetation
of this area (Camp and Hardy, 1999). The experimental site was located
on a hillslope of about 10% slope gradient. The site exhibited a grass-
land degradation gradient where soil basal cover decreased in an up-
slope direction. Its soils were classified as Plinthic Acrisols (WRB, 2006)
derived from sandstones and mudstones. More details about the study
site characteristics are in Dlamini et al. (2014), Mchunu and Chaplot
(2012) and Podwojewski et al. (2011).
2.2. The experimental design
Dlamini et al. (2011) initiated the experiment, in a rural
Catena 167 (2018) 284-292
community, with the aim of investigating potential techniques for re-
habilitating degraded communal grasslands. An area measuring
1500 m2 (30 m and showing morphologically, chemically and
physically homogeneous soils was demarcated. This area also showed
grassland degradation intensities with the downslope position non-de-
graded (grass aerial cover, of 100%), the mid-slope moderately de-
graded (25 < grass cover 50%), while the upslope position was
highly degraded (0 grass cover 5%) (Mchunu and Chaplot, 2012;
Dlamini et al., 2014). The demarcated area was further divided into
several upslope-downslope swaths so that each swatch, treated to a
specific grassland management technique, covered all three grass cover
levels (Dlamini et al., 2011; Mchunu and Chaplot, 2012; Dlamini et al.,
2014) The current study measured soil CO2 emissions from a ring-
fenced swath to eliminate any interaction with livestock, fires or any
other significant disturbance. The soil CO2 measurements were per-
formed at three randomly selected positions per grass cover level. A
plastic (PVC) collar (diameter 10 cm, height cm) was set up at
each position. The PVC collars were inserted 2 cm into the soi between
grass tufts, two weeks before the first CO2 emission measurements of to
avoid errors associated with soil disturbance (Hui-Mei et al., 2005;
Heinemeyer et al., 2011).
2.3. Soil CO2 emission measurements
The soil CO2 emission measurements were performed using a LI-
COR 6400XT gas analyzer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) fitted with a LI-
COR 6400-09 soil respiration chamber. The closed chamber system had
an internal volume of 991 cm3 and a surface area of 71.6 cm2 (Healy
et al., 1996). Immediately before CO2 measurement, the chamber was
positioned on the PVC collar. The measurements were performed once a
month during dry winters and twice a month in wet summers, from
January 2013 to April 2015. Three readings were recorded per mea-
suring position during each measurement session. Thus, 1053 soil CO2
emission records were generated in 39 days that the experimental site
was visited for the purpose of measuring soil CO2 emissions. On each
day, CO2 measurements were performed between 10.00 and 13.00 h to
avoid strong influences of diurnal variations. The CO2 fluxes, measured
by the LI-COR, were converted to CO2-C based on atomic weights of C
and oxygen. The fluxes were subsequently expressed in (i) gross soil
CO2 emission: g CO2 per unit of surface area (ii)
soil CO2 emission relative to SOCs: g CO2 per gram of soil C CO2-
Cg-1c day-1); and (iii) soil CO2 emission relative to amount of
aboveground biomass produced: 8 CO2 per kg of aboveground biomass
CO2-Ckg produced biomass
2.4. Soil temperature and soil water content
Topsoil (0-0.05 temperature and water content were measured
in conjunction with soil CO2 emissions. Temperature was measured
using a thermocouple connected to the LI-COR chamber. Water content
was measured using a Hydrosense soil moisture meter (Campbell
Scientific, Inc., USA), which was calibrated at the study site. The soil
temperature and water content measurements were performed at ran-
domly selected positions within a 0.2 m radius from each PVC collar.
2.5. Soil sampling and analysis
Topsoil (0-0.05 m samples were collected for evaluating SOC
(SOCc) and soil organic nitrogen (SONc) contents. Sampling was per-
formed in June 2014. Three replicate samples were collected from
randomly selected positions 0.2-1 m from each PVC collar. The samples
were first air-dried for before gently grinding and sieving them
through a 2 mm sieve. The soil particle size distribution was determined
on the sieved samples using the pipette method (Gee and Bauder,
1986). Total C and nitrogen content were measured using LECO CNS-
2000 Dumas dry matter combustion analyzer (LECO Corp., St. Joseph,
