correlated to WUE (Songsri et al., 2013). Limiting vegetative
growth also increases WUE. The cpm2 plants showed reduced
culm development (Figure S2D), which is also supported by
lower shoot dry weight under drought in cpm2 (Figure S7).

Overall, through the aerial morpho-physiologica parameters of
leaf rolling, WUE, stomatal conductance, and ABA content as
well as the root architecture of increased branching indicated that
cpm2 plants had a better potential to tolerate drought.

During drought stress, the root is the primary organ to sense
water scarcity in drying soil, triggering a cascade of responses at
morpho-physiological, biochemical, and cellular levels (Sengupta
et al., 2011) Hence comparative proteomic studies on roots were
