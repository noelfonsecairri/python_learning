constraining agriculture. Access to resources is identified
specifically in Africa, where poor market penetration renders
farmers unable to procure inputs. The different agricultural
systems dominant in each region shape the CSV design and key
interventions, from rice-based systems in Southeast Asia, mixed
crop-livestock systems in Africa, to coffee-based systems in Latin
America. Low resource use and subsistence agriculture in Africa
give low agricultural yields, whereas excessive resource use in
South Asia (Punjab/Haryana, India) results in ecosystem
degradation and environmental concerns.

As can be expected from the baseline assessments, technological
interventions being piloted in CSV regions are very different. The
portfolio of options in the South Asia CSVs had synergistic effects
(Jat et al. 2014, Khatri-Chetri et al. 2016). Similarly, studies in all
regions showed that there is considerable yield advantage when a
portfolio of technologies is used, rather than technologies being
used in isolation (Govaerts et al 2005, Zougmore et al. 2014) For
example, crop rotation with legumes, incorporation of crop
residues and compost with minimum tillage enhances soil
nutrients and ameliorates water stress through improved soil
