Simulating rice and maize yield potential in the humid tropical environment
Nurwulan Agustiania Nanyan Dengb, Juan I. Rattallino Edreira Setia S. Girsanga, Syafruddina
ABSTRACT A
Little is known about the yield potential of modern rice and, particularly, maize cultivars in the tropical humid
environment of Indonesia where farmers can grow 2-3 consecutive crops on the same piece of land per year This
study provides a first step to fill this knowledge gap by using two crop simulation models to estimate yield
potential for rice and maize based on experiments conducted across multiple site-years and measured weather
and soil data. Data collected from well-managed irrigated experiments, with observed yields ranging from 7.8 to
10 Mg ha (rice) and 12 to 14.4 Mg ha (maize), were used to calibrate phenology and growth coefficients for
both a rice (OryzaV3) and maize crop model (Hybrid Maize). The calibration was performed for commercial,
high-yielding irrigated rice and maize cultivars. Subsequently, calibrated models were evaluated on their ability
to simulate yield potential using an independent database available from variety (irrigated rice) and fertilizer
(irrigated and rainfed maize) trials conducted at multiple site-years across major rice and maize producing areas
in Indonesia. Calibrated coefficients for rice were robust at reproducing observed leaf area, aboveground bio-
mass, and biomass partitioning to different plant organs. In the case of maize, close agreement between simu-
lated and observed yields suggests that the generic growth model coefficients originally derived for temperate
maize performed well at simulating yield potential of modern tropical maize hybrids. The two models re-
produced with acceptable performance the maximum observed yields across variety and fertilizer trials, except
for rainfed maize grown in a region with very heavy clay soils. Across site-years, yield potential for irrigated rice
and maize averaged 9.1 and 11.6 Mg ha respectively, while rainfed maize averaged 11.5 Mg ha
Comparison between simulated yields and average national rice and maize yields (5.2 and 5 Mg ha respec-
tively) suggested that room exists to further increase average farmer yields in rice and maize-based crop systems.
Our study also highlighted the high yield potential of modern maize hybrids grown in intensive crop sequences

needed to assess potential extra food production, set realistic yield goals
and associated water and nutrient requirements, and identify oppor-
tunities for improving yield and input-use efficiency. Crop simulation
models provide a robust approach for estimating Yp and Yw (van
Ittersum et al., 2013). These models rely on weather, soil, and man-
agement data to simulate the influence of genotype, environment, and

1. Introduction
Yield potential (Yp) is defined as the yield of a well-adapted crop
cultivar with non-limiting water and nutrients, and with biotic stresses
effectively controlled (Evans, 1993). Water-limited yield potential (Yw)
is similar to Yp but it also accounts for the influence of water supply
amount and distribution during the growing season and soil properties
influencing the crop water balance, such as rootable soil depth,
