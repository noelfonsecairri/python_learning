current result.
Other factors such as soil bulk density, which Chaplot et al. (2015)
showed to significantly decrease soil CO2 emissions under a maize
22
production system, appeared to have no significant effect on soil CO2
emission in the current study. However, top-soil C:N ratio correlated
positively with gross soil CO2 emission, which agreed with findings by
20
several previous studies (e.g. Whitaker et al., 2014; Spohn, 2015;
Abdalla et al., 2016). Spohn (2015) explained such positive correlation
in terms of three microbial mechanisms; nitrogen mining, overflow
respiration, and enzyme inhibition.
