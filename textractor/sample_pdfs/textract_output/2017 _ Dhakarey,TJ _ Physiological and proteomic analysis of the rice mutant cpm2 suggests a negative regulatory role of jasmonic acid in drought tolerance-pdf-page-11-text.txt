Heat map of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) belonging to ROS scavenging, cell wall, cell organization, phenyipropanoids, energy,
proteincatabolism and miscellaneous categories obtained after TMT (Tandem Mass Tag) analysis of cpm2 and wild type (WT) roots. Differential proteins were abundant
in cpm2 (except nSHB2 and PIP-2) as evident from the log ratios (stress/control). TMT based LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on rice roots after drought treatment
of cpm2 and corresponding WT. Total protein was extracted and subsequent FASP digestion was performed. The subsequent peptide mixture was labeled
with
the
TMT reagent prior to multiplexing. Pooled peptides were fractioned using the reversed-phase HPLC system and then individual fractions were analyzed
using
Tandem
mass spectrometry. For each protein the ID according to MSU is provided in parenthesis. The color scale indicates whether a protein is more or less abundant under
drought conditions. Cross marks indicate that the protein was unidentified in the respective sample.
