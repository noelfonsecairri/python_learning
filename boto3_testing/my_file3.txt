Abstract
Increasing water scarcity and rapid socio-economic development are driving farmers in Asia
to transform traditionally flooded rice cropping systems into non-flooded crop production.
The management of earthworms in non-flooded rice fields appears to be a promising strategy
to support residue recycling and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions triggered by
residue amendment. We conducted a field experiment on non-flooded rainfed rice fields, with
and without residue amendment. In-situ mesocosms were inoculated with endogeic
earthworms (Metaphire sp.), with either low (ET1: 150 individuals or high density (ET2:
450 individuals m*2), and a control (ETO: no earthworms). We measured GHG emissions
(methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); carbon dioxide (CO2)) twice a week during the
cropping season with static chambers. Effects of earthworms on yield and root growth were
additionally assessed. Earthworms offset the enormous increase of CH4 emissions induced by
straw amendment (from 4.6 + 5 to 75.3 + 46 kg CH4-C ha- in ETO). Earthworm activity
significantly reduced CH4 release, particularly at ET2, by more than one-third (to 22 + 15 kg
CH4-C In contrast, earthworm inoculation did not affect N2O emission. Straw
amendment more than doubled the global warming potential (GWP). Earthworms reduced
GWP by 39 % at low (ET1) and 55 % at high densities (ET2). Earthworm activity reduced
root mass density under conditions of straw amendment but did not affect yield. Earthworms
can significantly reduce detrimental effects of rice crop residue amendment on GHG release
under upland rice production. Organic carbon (C) might be preserved in earthworm casts and
thereby limit C availability for CH4 production. At the same time, earthworm activity might
increase methanotrophic CH4 consumption, due to improved soil aeration or less root
exudates. Consequently, earthworms have a strong potential for regulating ecosystem
functions related to rice straw decomposition, nutrient allocation and thus GHG reduction.

1 Introduction
The mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, rice straw residue recycling and
management adaptations towards more sustainable rice production are among the major
challenges for agriculture in Southeast Asia. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main staple food for
more than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005). At the same time, global rice
production contributes about 16 % to anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission and, although
CH4's atmospheric concentration is much lower than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), its global
warming potential (GWP) on a 100 year time span is approximately 28 times larger (IPCC,
2014). Increasing water scarcity and Asia's rapid socio-economic development are driving
farmers to transform their traditionally flooded double rice cropping systems into diversified
rice crop rotations, including non-flooded crops such as upland (aerobic) rice or maize
(Timsina et al., 2010; Wassmann et al., 2000, Belder et al., 2005). This, along with the need
for feasible and sustainable adaptation strategies in rice production, may create some
synergies in terms of CH4 emission. Recent studies have reported a reduction of CH4
emissions of up to 84 % in a crop rotation of flooded rice and non-flooded upland rice as
compared to continuously flooded rice cultivation (Cha-un et al. ,2017), however,
accompanied by an increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (Wassmann et al., 2000; Weller
et al., 2016) The latter gas is also known for an extremely high GWP. The introduction of
upland crops into paddy rice systems goes along with a drastically altered water regime,
leading not only to changes in the soil microbial community and its activity (Breidenbach et
al., 2015; Breidenbach et al., 2017), but also in soil physicochemical properties. This creates
the possibility of establishing a more diverse soil fauna by promoting less flood-resistant
species like earthworms (Schmidt et al., 2016).

Journal Pre-proof
Earthworms and their effect on CH4 emissions are the subject of controversial debate,
since the results of recent investigations range from a considerable reduction (Moon et al.,
2010; Park et al., 2008) to an acceleration of methanogenic activity (Depkat-Jakob et al.,
2012), with the latter being attributed to the stimulating effect of substrates from earthworm
guts and in fresh casts. Generally, earthworms are considered to protect soil organic carbon
(C) in their cast aggregates (Wolters, 2000). Elevated microbial activity in earthworm casts
and burrow walls, however, may increase soil respiration rates (Kizilkaya and Hepsen, 2004;
Parkin and Berry, 1999; Tiunov and Dobrovolskaya, 2002; Tiunov and Scheu, 1999). And
also elevated N2O emissions due to earthworm activity as reported by Lubbers et al. (2013)
may be mainly caused by microorganisms benefitting from improved metabolic conditions in
both intestines and casts of earthworms (Horn et al., 2003). Enhanced denitrification from the
latter leads to increased N2O emissions (Majeed et al., 2013). In contrast, several studies have
shown that earthworms increase CO2 but not N2O fluxes (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2010; Speratti
and Whalen, 2008) and even considerable reductions of N2O emission (Chen et al., 2014).
Due to these partially contradictory results reported from various agroecosystems, there is still
some uncertainty regarding the interplay of earthworm-induced soil organic matter
stabilization and mobilization, as well as resulting GHG emissions. Consequently, it is
important to measure all three GHGs from certain land use systems and management
practices to be able to assess the contribution of earthworm activity to the net GHG balance
over time.
Additional challenges for a comprehensive assessment of the role of earthworms in
maintaining C-storage and affecting GHG emissions from soils are associated with the effects
of crop residue return. Rice straw incorporation is becoming increasingly popular for nutrient
return in rice agroecosystems (Janz et al., 2019) as an environmentally-friendly alternative to
straw burning (Huang et al., 2013). Rice straw open-field burning is still a widely practiced
5
Journal Pre-proof
residue disposal practice in the Philippines (Gadde et al., 2009). Despite the intuitively
positive effects of straw burning associated with the rapid return of nutrients into the soil in
ash, those are outweigh by the negative influence of the organic matter combustion on
climate, air quality and public health (Huang et al., 2013; Streets et al., 2003; Tipayarom and
Oanh, 2007). Thus farmers have been encouraged to adopt alternative strategies for the
disposal of the relatively poor-quality rice straw residue material (Jiang et al., 2018). Rice
straw application has been reported to stabilize soil moisture and to improve soil fertility
(Devevre and Horwath, 2000 Xia et al., 2014) At the same time, however, it may entail the
risks of reducing rice production efficiencies (Mandal et al., 2004; Yadvinder-Singh et al.,
2005) and increasing GHG emissions (Janz et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2014; Sander and
Wassmann, 2014). The input of organic matter, such as rice residues, to rice soil promotes
CH4 emissions (Bronson et 1.,1997; Wassmann et al., 2000) as it provides additional
substrate for methanogenic microorganisms (Le Mer and Roger, 2001) In non-flooded rice
ecosystems, however, rice residue amendment might be especially promising if accompanied
by natural colonization by earthworms or active soil fauna management. The presence of
earthworms may increase the benefits of straw amendment, as they can accelerate the initial
degradation of residue material (Lubbers et al., 2017), and thus positively affect plant growth
(Fonte and Six, 2010; Noguera et al., 2010) Positive feedbacks of earthworms to nutrient
decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth have long been recognized and are well-
established (e.g. Brown et al., 1999; Darwin, 1881; Scheu, 2003; Wolters and Stickan, 1991;
Xiao et al., 2018). This is mainly achieved by releasing nitrogen from the residue material and
soil organic matter (see e.g. van Groenigen et al., 2014). Brown et al. (1999) observed an
average increase in plant growth of more than 50 % due to the presence of earthworms in
tropical soils, especially if accompanied by the application of additional organic C sources
(Blouin et al., 2013; van Groenigen et al., 2014)
6
Journal Pre-proof
Evidence from various agroecosystems suggests that the introduction of earthworms
into paddy soils may considerably contribute to the regulation and stimulation of microbial
crop residue decomposition as well as to the improvement of nutrient availability for plants,
while it may simultaneously mitigate GHG emissions (e.g. John et al., 2015; van Groenigen et
al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2018) Before recommending earthworm addition or active promotion of
local earthworm populations as a convenient measure for increasing the sustainable
management of upland rice soils amended with crop residues, however, it will be crucial to
fully understand both the potential and the risks associated with earthworm effects on GHG
emissions and crop productivity. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the pros and cons of these
effects have never been experimentally quantified in the field. To fill this gap, we conducted a
full-factorial experiment at non-flooded rainfed rice fields of the IRRI experimental farm (Los
Banos, Philippines). The experiment was carried out in contained mesocosms with three
different levels of earthworm density (ETO: no earthworms, ET1: 150 ind. m-2 ET2: 450 ind.
m-2) as well as with and without rice straw amendment. The impact of these treatments on
GHG release and on the GWP was quantified by means of closed chamber measurements. We
measured both gas fluxes from bare soil and from soil with rice plants to better understand the
potential GHG mitigation by earthworm presence. We hypothesized that earthworm addition
reduces the GWP after rice straw amendment by supressing the stimulation of CH4 emissions
without boosting N2O and CO2 release. In addition, we determined treatment-specific
differences in rice yield, shoot biomass and root mass density. The underlying hypothesis was
that earthworm-induced physicochemical changes alter both growth and productivity of rice
plants.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Field Site Description
The field experiment was established at the experimental farm of the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI), Los Banos, Philippines (60 km south of Manila). The site is located
at 1409'45" N, 121015'35" E, at an elevation of 21 m above sea level. The cropping year is
determined by a dry season (DS) and wet season (WS) as rainfall is unevenly distributed over
the year. 15 % of annual rainfall fells from Jan-May (DS) and 85 % fells in the period Jun-
Dec (WS). The experiment was conducted during the rice cropping phase of the wet season
2016 (July-October). The mean temperature during the cropping season was 28.9 C, with a
total rainfall of 1004 mm (IRRI Climate Unit 2016). The highest rainfall was recorded in
September 2016 (32.4 of total seasonal precipitation), due to a tropical storm at the end of
the month. The soil had a clay-dominated texture (54.2 clay, 32.8 % silt, 13 % sand) and a
pH of 6.6. It was classified as "Andaqueptic Haplaquoll" (USDA classification) or
"Anthraquic Gleysol" according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. Field
management was in accordance with the existing crop rotation scheme, alternating between
maize in the dry season and non-flooded upland rice in the wet season for four years before
the start of the experiment.
2.2 Set-Up of Contained Soil Mesocosms and Agronomic Practice
A total of 24 containments ("soil-plant mesocosms") were installed at two adjacent 14 m X 20
m fields (12 each) to confine earthworms to the enclosed soil. Containment structures for the
in-situ mesocosm experiment were made of plastic buckets with 60 cm diameter (= 0.28 m2
surface area) and 70 cm height. Each was evenly perforated with 120 holes (5 cm diameter)
8
Journal Pre-proof
that were manually drilled in the side walls and the bottom of the buckets (Supplementary
material Figure S.2-A). 500 um nylon mesh fabric layered to the inside of the mesocosms
ensured permeability for soil water, nutrients, microorganisms and soil mesofauna but
prevented both escape of inoculated earthworms and invasion of local soil macrofauna (see
e.g. Setala et al., 1996). Mesocosms were installed as soon as the usual land preparation
practice for upland rice cultivation had been carried out (see below). They were located at a
maximum distance to the field boundaries (min. 3 m) and at a distance of 2.5 m between the
external borders of adjacent mesocosms, to avoid edge effects and mutual interference. The
mesocosms were buried in the ground to a depth of 60 cm (i.e. 10 cm still protruded above
ground) and filled with the original excavated soil. The soil was compacted to the surface
level of the surrounding field. When filling the mesocosms, care was taken to ensure that no
cavities were created between the soil inside and outside of the containers to ensure maximum
coalescence. The soil used for the experiment was not defaunated, since earthworms were
absent from the experimental fields after field preparation. Other soil macrofauna groups (e.g.
gastropods or mole crickets) were manually removed.
For land preparation, the fields were soaked for about one week before ploughing and
harrowing until July 15, 2016 (see Supplementary material Table S.1 for the schedule of field
activities). The fields and contained mesocosms were manually levelled and mesocosm soil
was left undisturbed to settle for a few days before the transplanting of rice seedlings on July
21, 2016 (Supplementary material Table S.1). Three-week-old dry-bed grown seedlings of
aerobic rice (NSIC Rc192) were manually transplanted in straight rows with equal distances
of 20 cm X 20 cm spacing between hills and one to two seedlings per hill. Each mesocosm
was planted with 7 hills in an identical pattern (see Supplementary material Figure S.2-B). A
basal fertilization of 30 kg ha- K (as potash) and 30 kg ha- P (as solophos) was conducted
shortly after transplanting Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application occurred in three splits and
9
Journal Pre-proof
quantities of 30, 50, and 50 kg urea-N ha at 8, 26 and 34 days after transplanting (DAT;
Supplementary material Table S.1). Wooden planks were installed on July 25, 2016 (4 DAT)
to reach the mesocosms while minimizing disturbance to surrounding rice plants. The fields
were irrigated if necessary in case of drought, and drainage channels were opened in case of
heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding. Rice was harvested by hand on October 19, 2016 (90
DAT).
2.3 Straw and Earthworm Treatments
The experiment followed a full-factorial design of two different straw residue treatments and
three levels of earthworm densities in four replicates each. We established the field
experiment with 2 X 12 mesocosms in two bunded fields. One of the two fields received no
rice straw ("Without Straw'), while the other field received 6 Mg ha" air dried rice straw
("With Straw'), partly incorporated during field-preparation (3 Mg ha-) and applied as mulch
after rice seedling transplanting (3 Mg ha to preserve soil moisture and avoid crack
formation (Mousavi et al., 2012) Mesocosms in both fields were subject to three earthworm
treatments with zero (ETO), 150 (ET1) and 450 individuals (ind.) m2 (ET2), relating to 42 and
126 mature individuals of the earthworm genus Metaphire sp. per mesocosm, respectively.
Earthworms were collected from grasslands in close vicinity to the experimental sites. The
ET1 earthworm density equals the natural abundance of the earthworm species in the original
habitat, while ET2 represents a three-fold increased density treatment. To adapt to field soil
conditions, earthworms were incubated in a styrofoam box filled with soil from the
experimental field for five days prior to mesocosm inoculation. After rice transplanting,
earthworms were transferred to the respective mesocosms on August 1, 2016 (11 DAT). See
Supplementary material Figure S.1 for a dimensionally accurate schematic overview of the
10
Journal Pre-proof
field experimental design and Supplementary material Table S.1 for the field activity
schedule.
After harvest, all mesocosm containers were removed from the fields and the soil was
manually examined to count for earthworms. We recovered an average of 27 + 5 and 61 + 22
individuals for the ET1 and ET2 treatments, respectively. Despite the apparently low
recovery, the difference between the two earthworm treatments was still significant (P <
0.001) Moreover, the recovery rate was not affected by the initial earthworm density (ET1:
64.6 + 11.8 % ET2: 48.5 + 16.0 % P = 0.452) and is within the usual range reported for this
type of experiment (Lubbers and van Groenigen, 2013; Paul et al., 2012; van Groenigen et al.,
2014). Straw application did not affect the recovery rate either (P - 0.755).
Bulk soil and rhizosphere soil (0-10 cm & 10-20 cm depth) were manually collected
with soil corers (3 cm in diameter) at the beginning (10 DAT) and after the experiment (2
DAH) within each confinement for analyses of the soil C and N amount using a CN elemental
analyser (Vario Max, Hanau, Germany).
2.4 Greenhouse Gas Measurements
Soil CH4, CO2 and N2O gas fluxes were measured using manually operated static closed
chambers consisting of a permanent frame installed in the field and mobile measurement
chambers. Two chamber frames were installed at each of the 24 mesocosms, one covering
bare soil without plants (N-frames) and one covering the middle hill including the rice plants
(P-frames), and remained installed for the duration of the experiment (see Supplementary
material Figure S.2-B). While P-chamber measurements captured emissions from soil, roots,
and rice plants, N-chamber measurements were not directly affected by plants However, as
N-chamber fluxes are also influenced by roots and associated rhizosphere processes that
11
Journal Pre-proof
extend over the entire soil matrix, we were aware that they do not only measure bare soil
emissions.
N-frames consisted of a circular plastic (PVC) base frame (25 cm length, 15 cm in
diameter), inserted 10 cm into the soil of each mesocosm between hills, covering bare soil
with no plant inside The respective N-chambers were made of non-transparent PVC piping
material with a fixed height of 11.5 cm (6.5 cm overlap, 15 cm in diameter), resulting in a
total height of 20 cm when attached to the base frame.
P-frames consisted of a larger circular base frame (25 cm in diameter, 20cm length),
inserted about 10 cm into the soil, covering the middle hill of rice plants in each mesocosm,
with an above-ground frame height of another 10 cm. The respective P-chambers were
constructed from semi-transparent, plastic water gallons with a diameter of 25.5 cm and used
in variable chamber heights (35, 65, 95, 120 cm), depending on the height of the plant inside
the chamber. The overlap of frame and chamber was covered with a 3.5 cm rubber band,
forming an airtight seal.
Both chamber types were equipped with ports for gas sampling, a thermometer and a
vent for pressure equilibration. Gas samples were collected from inside the chambers using a
60 mL syringe at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min time points after chamber closure. A battery-powered
fan was installed inside the P-chambers to ensure a well-mixed air sample, particularly with
increasing chamber size. The air inside the N-chambers was thoroughly mixed by flushing
three times with the 60 mL volume of the sampling syringe right before each sampling. A 10
mL glass vial with butyl rubber septum was flushed (30 mL) with sample air before it was
filled and over pressurized with 15 mL of the same sample Sampling took place twice a week
during the entire rice growing season (11-88 DAT; 23 measurement days in total) between
8:30 and 10:30 a.m. to capture the mean of diurnal variabilities, according to protocol settings
(e.g. Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2016, Sander and Wassmann, 2014). Soil temperature and water
12
Journal Pre-proof
filled pore space (WFPS) were monitored during each measurement occasion (see
Supplementary material Figure S.3). The gas samples were transported to Germany and
analysed with a gas chromatograph (GC; 8610C SRI Instruments) equipped with an Ni
electron capture detector (ECD) for analysis of N2O, and a flame ionization detector (FID)
and methanizer for analysis of CH4 and CO2.
Hourly flux rates were calculated by linear regression of the four measurement points,
based on the ideal gas law, and corrected by chamber air temperature and air pressure
(Minamikawa et al., 2015) The daily gas flux was calculated by multiplying the mean hourly
gas flux by 24. Cumulative seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated from the daily
emissions between every two consecutive measurements from the P- and N-chamber average
using linear interpolation. Interpolated daily gas fluxes were summed up to calculate the
emissions for vegetative (0-25 DAT), reproductive (26-55 DAT), and ripening (56-90 DAT)
growth stages as well as total seasonal emissions. The GWP (CH4 and N2Q) was estimated
using the radiative forcing potentials (relative to CO2, for a 100-year time horizon without the
inclusion of climate-C feedback), i.e. 265 and 28 for N2O and CH4, respectively (Myhre et al.,
2013). GWP was averaged across P- and N-chambers. CO2 fluxes were only used to analyse
the relative changes of treatment effects from chambers without plants (N), but not included
in the calculations of seasonal emissions and GWP, because they were affected by plant
photosynthesis in P-chambers.
2.5 Rice Yield, Shoot Biomass and Root Mass Density Assessment
Above-ground biomass was harvested from the mesocosms on October 19, 2016 (90 DAT)
and analysed for rice grain yield (corrected to 14% moisture content), dry weight of straw
and harvest index, following the ORYZA 2000 crop data collection protocol (IRRI, 2009).
13
Journal Pre-proof
Root mass density was determined as described by Henry et al. (2012) as a proxy for
root production under field conditions. The respective soil cores (60 cm in depth, 3 cm in
diameter) were sampled two days after harvest (Supplementary material Table S.1) within the
mesocosms in between two hills. Each soil core was cut into four pieces, which were
separately placed on sieves (355 um) and washed under running water to separate soil
particles from the rice roots. The roots were dried for 48 hours at 63C before weighing. Total
root mass density per mesocosm was calculated by summing up the resulting root weights of
the four pieces of the respective soil cores. Root mass values were converted to g (dry weight)
cm-3 according to the soil core volume.
2.6 Statistical Analysis
GHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, and CO2) were analysed using the general linear model procedure in
R (version 3.4.3) with forward and backward stepwise inclusion of variables. Independent
categorical predictors were "earthworm" (three levels), "'straw application" (two levels),
"chamber type" (two levels), "growth stage" (three levels of rice growth: the vegetative
growth stage, the reproductive and the ripening stage, to examine inter-seasonal dynamics of
the earthworm treatments on GHG release during the cropping season) as well as their
interactions. Dependent variables were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity of
variance and adjusted by logarithmic transformation if they did not meet the criteria.
Seasonal cumulative GHG emissions were analysed for the impact of earthworm and
straw residue treatment as well as of chamber type (P- and N-chambers) by means of multiple
factorial analyses of variance (ANOVA, R package "agricolae" V. 1.2-8). Hence, seasonal
cumulative GHG emission was analysed for each growth stage with chamber type as fixed
effect, while replication was the random effect.
14
Journal Pre-proof
GWP as well as plant parameters (rice yield, shoot biomass, root mass density) were
compared across earthworm and straw residue treatments. Multiple comparisons among
treatment means were performed using the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant
difference) test on a probability level of 5 % or lower (R package "agricolae" V. 1.2-8).

3 Results
3.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
3.1.1 Methane Flux
Earthworm density and straw application significantly affected the magnitude of CH4 fluxes
during aerobic rice cultivation (Table 1). Earthworms significantly decreased seasonal
cumulative emissions in the treatment with straw application by 43 and 71 % under ET1 and
ET2, respectively (Table 2). Significant interactions between straw and earthworm treatment
thus suggest a strong modulation of earthworm effects by the addition of rice straw as an
additional C source (Table 1). On average, rice straw application increased CH4 emissions by
a
factor of 10 (Table 2). Only in the field without straw amendment were occasional increases
in CH4 flux observed when earthworms were present during the vegetative or reproductive
growth stage (Figure 1). However, the magnitude of CH4 emission was on a very low level
compared to the field receiving rice straw (Table 2).
CH4 emissions were increased by rice plants inside the measurement chambers (P-
chambers compared to N-chambers; Table 1). Total seasonal emissions accumulated to 19.8 +
9.5 kg CH4-C ha-l in chambers without and to 31.4 + 8.7 kg CH4-C ha- with rice plants. Most
of the CH4 (80-99 % %) was emitted during vegetative and reproductive growth stages,
irrespective of plants and straw residues (Figure 1). During these earlier growth stages,
significantly larger amounts of CH4 were detected in mesocosms without earthworm
inoculation compared to mesocosms with ET2 earthworm inoculation under conditions of rice
straw residue amendment (Table 2). ET1 significantly reduced cumulative CH4 emissions as
well, but only in N-chambers (Table 2). This effect was negligible in P-chambers.
Peak emissions in chambers with and without plants were reached at 28 DAT. After
that, magnitude and variation of flux measurements gradually decreased during the
16
Journal Pre-proof
reproductive growth stage until 43 DAT and remained low for the rest of the season (Figure
1). The ripening stage did not significantly contribute to total seasonal CH4 emissions.
However, seasonal emissions decreased with increasing earthworm density in all chambers
when straw was applied (Table 2).

3.1.2 Nitrous Oxide Fluxes
N2O fluxes were generally low with occasional peak emissions during the upland rice
growing season (Supplementary material Figure S.4). Neither earthworm nor rice straw
residue treatment had a significant effect on N2O fluxes (Table 1). Only seasonal cumulative
N2O emissions from the field without rice straw residue amendment were significantly lower
in mesocosms without earthworms (ETO) C
Table 3). Averaged across both chamber types with and without plants, emissions increased
by about 50 % from 2.1 + 1.4 kg N2O-N ha- (ETO) to 3.0 + 1.8 and 3.2 + 1.7 kg N2O-N ha-

under ET1 and ET2 earthworm density, respectively, when no straw was amended. Peak
emissions were measured particularly after urea-N fertilization during the reproductive
growth phase under earthworm presence in ET1 (P-chambers) and ET2 both with and without
plants (Supplementary material Figure S.4). However, no such effect was observed when rice
straw was applied to the field.

3.1.3 Carbon Dioxide Flux
Soil CO2 fluxes from in between plants increased significantly due to the amendment of rice
straw, but they were not affected by earthworm treatment (Table 1; Supplementary material
Figure S.5). Seasonal cumulative CO2 emission increased by 36 % with rice straw residue
amendment (from 694 to 947 kg CO2-C ha- season) Comparisons within the growth stages
and straw treatments revealed an earthworm effect on CO2 emissions (Table 4). During the
vegetative and reproductive growth stage, CO2 release was significantly increased by ET2,
but only in the field without rice straw residue amendment. No clear pattern of earthworms
affecting CO2 emissions was observed in the field amended with rice straw residue. Overall,
CO2 emission was lowest under ET1 compared to ETO and ET2 during the vegetative and
ripening stage.

3.2 Global Warming Potential (CH4 + N2O)
Without straw addition, N2O emissions accounted for the largest share of GWP (approx. 90
%), whereas up to 72 % of total GWP resulted from CH4 emissions in the rice straw
treatment. The strongly elevated CH4 emissions under rice straw application significantly
increased the GWP (P < 0.001; Figure 2). Average emissions, equal to 2007 kg CO2-C ha"
season occurred when straw was amended, which is more than twice as high as compared to
the field without residue input (854.6 kg CO2-C eq. ha- season)
Earthworm presence significantly supressed the stimulating effect of straw amendment
on CH4 production and thereby reduced the GWP during upland rice cultivation (Figure 2). A
strong modulation of straw-induced CH4 emissions by earthworm presence and density was
suggested by the significant interaction effect (P < 0.05). The highest seasonal peak in GWP
occurred shortly after rice straw residue amendment (ETO: 2927.9 kg CO2-C eq. ha- season
Figure 2). ET1 and ET2 supressed that instant stimulating effect of straw amendment on CH4
production (Table 2) and consequently reduced the GWP by 39 % and 55 %, respectively
(Figure 2), mainly caused by differences during vegetative and reproductive growth stages.
No earthworm effect on GWP was observed in mesocosms without rice straw residue
amendment.

3.3 Rice Yield, Shoot Biomass, Root Mass Density, and Soil Parameters
Neither the dry mass of the harvested rice straw from the mesocosms nor the harvest index
were affected by different earthworm densities or rice straw residue management
(Supplementary material Table S.2; Table 5). Grain yield, in contrast, though not affected by
earthworms, was significantly reduced by straw amendment (Supplementary material Table
S.2; Table 5). Average rice yields declined from 7.4 + 1.7 Mg ha- without straw amendment
23
Journal Pre-proof
to 6.0 + 1 Mg ha" with straw. Only under earthworm density ET1 were rice yields practically
identical with and without straw residue amendment (Table 5).
Root mass density was significantly reduced by earthworm activity in fields with rice
straw residue amendment (Supplementary material Table S.2; Table 5). Particularly the ET1
earthworm density resulted in the lowest root mass density (21.1 + 2.5 g cm-3 Supplementary
material Table S.2), significantly different from mesocosms without earthworms (ETO: 49.7 +
7.6 g cm-3; Table 5).

Discussion
The experiment reported here demonstrates a considerable potential of native earthworms to
mitigate increased CH4 emissions and GWP (CH4 and N2O) induced by rice straw addition to
non-flooded paddy soils. This is supported by earlier findings implicating that earthworms
increase the sustainability of agricultural systems as they modify nutrient allocation, GHG
emission, and plant productivity by affecting soil conditions, microbial community
composition and crop residue decomposition (Byers et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2015; Lavelle
et al., 2016). The promotion of local earthworm populations thus seems to provide a feasible
management option for increasing the sustainability of upland rice production.
Rice straw amendment per se detrimentally affected crop yield, strongly increased
CO2 emissions and CH4 release, and ultimately raised GWP (CH4 and N2O) by more than 400
%. This was accompanied by a shift from N2O to CH4 as the major contributor to total GWP.
The effect of crop residues on CH4 and CO2 production was earlier explained by a number of
mechanisms (e.g. microbial activity stimulation) (Conrad, 2002; Glissmann and Conrad,
2006; Kimura et al., 2004), but based on the set of parameters that we measured, we can only
speculate which mechanisms were realistic in our experimental fields. Our experiment was
conducted under well-drained, aerobic soil conditions. However, wet season rainfall events
(Supplementary material Figure S.3) coupled with straw addition may have occasionally led
to anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (Janz et al. 2019). According to Rath et al.
(2005), CH4 emissions from non-flooded rice fields amended with rice straw can be almost as
high as those from flooded fields without residue addition. CH emission was highest shortly
after straw addition and gradually decreased during the cropping season to zero at ripening
This further demonstrates that CH4 release strongly depends on the availability of non-
metabolized crop residues and fades with progressing state of decomposition.
25
Journal Pre-proof
The potential of earthworms to mitigate CH4 emission has been shown by several
authors for various soil types and environmental conditions (e.g. Kernecker et al., 2014;
Moon et al., 2010; Park et al., 2008) Our results suggest, however, that this effect is
particularly pronounced when the proportion of undecomposed organic material is high.
Earthworm-induced reductions of CH4 release after rice straw addition to non-saturated paddy
soils may be the result of a variety of processes. First, earthworm activity may limit C
availability for methanogenic archaea by stabilizing and physically protecting straw-derived C
sources in soil macro- and microaggregates (Bossuyt et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2017) Then,
earthworms may stimulate the growth and activity of methanotrophic bacteria (Kim et al.,
2011; Moon et al., 2010; Park et al., 2008). And finally, by increasing the diffusion rate of
oxygen into the soil profile, earthworms may decrease the availability of favourable anoxic
microsites for methanogens (Kernecker et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016). In our study,
earthworm-related mitigation of CH4 emission was particularly strong at the beginning of the
cropping season, and lasted until approx. 40 DAT, when most of the straw was decomposed.
Even the sharp increase in CH4 release caused by heavy rains and the associated increase of
water saturation at 20-30 DAT (Neue et al., 1996) was significantly buffered in the earthworm
treatments. Thus, in contrast to a microcosm experiment with the earthworm Pheretima sp.
(John et al., 2015), the addition of Metaphire sp. does not seem to increase the risk of CH4
emissions under conditions of high inflow of water in the field. These seemingly
contradictory results can most probably be explained by the fact that endogeic earthworms
increased the porosity of soils and, thus, promoted the accumulation of backwater in the
bottom layers of soil-filled microcosms but increased water outflow under field conditions
(Trojan and Linden, 1992). The strong increase of CH4 emissions (factor > 2.6) in
measurement chambers with rice plants compared to those without plants is in accordance
with Butterbach-Bahl et al. (1997), who reported that a high proportion of CH4 is transported
26
Journal Pre-proof
through rice plants' aerenchymatous stem tissue. Earthworms were most effective in
mitigating bare soil-derived CH4 emission between rice plants (N), but only reduced CH4
release in plant covered areas (P) at high density (ET2). With increasing earthworm density,
more individuals probably entered the root zone, where they altered rhizodeposited C
resources (Shao et al., 2019) and thus affected CH4 emission. Interestingly, such effects are
visible only after straw amendment.
Earthworm effects on N2O emission were limited to treatments without rice straw
amendment. The significant, yet short-term increase in N2O emissions after fertilizer
application during the reproductive growth stage observed at ET1 and ET2 partly supports the
findings of other authors (Borken et al., 2000; Lubbers et al., 2011; Lubbers et al., 2013;
Marhan et al., 2010; Rizhiya et al., 2007). However, it contradicts the earthworm-induced
reduction of net N2O release from rice soil reported by Chen et al. (2014). Plant N uptake and
the diffusion of N2O to the atmosphere may both be increased by improved soil aeration and
porosity as a result of high earthworm activity (ET2) The increase of N2O emissions
nevertheless was much lower in our study than postulated in other studies (Borken et al.,
2000; Lubbers et al., 2013; Lubbers et al., 2011), particularly after residue amendment
(Giannopoulos et al., 2010; Rizhiya et al., 2007). One explanation might be that different
functional groups of earthworms can have quite contrasting effects on GHG emissions (see
e.g. Majeed et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). For example, denitrifying microorganisms do not
seem to be affected in the same way in the gut of Metaphire sp. as has been reported for other
earthworm species (Horn et al., 2003). The cyclic increase of N2O release in our experiment
can partly be explained by the obvious association between N2O evolution and N fertilizer
application (Bouwman et al., 2002). Additionally, N2O emission peaks might have been
triggered by dry-wet alternations resulting from heavy rainfall events between two dry periods
(11-18 DAT and 35-54 DAT) (Zou et al., 2005). Whether the improvement of soil aeration by
27
Journal Pre-proof
earthworm activity contributes to the buffering of such dry-wet cycle induced peaks of N2O
emission has to be tested in the future.
We did not detect any effect of straw amendment on N2O flux at any time of the
cropping season, although rice residue addition is thought to increase N uptake by plants
(Verma and Bhagat, 1992). Yao et al. (2017) recently described strongly diminished N2O
emissions after straw amendment, with improved N use efficiency by plants and hence
increased yields from wheat-based crop rotations in China. However, this did not occur in our
experiment carried out under conditions of aerobic upland rice cropping. Rice straw is a
residue with relatively poor-quality, due to low N content, a high C/N ratio as well as high
lignin and polyphenol contents (Jiang et al., 2018) Therefore, its decomposition bears the risk
of microbial immobilization of N (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which can lead to negative
short-term effects on crop production. However, proper N-fertilization management (e.g. 130
kg N in three splits as in this experiment) can reduce N immobilization after straw
amendment (Eagle et al., 2000; Mandal et al., 2004), but can also allow N2O emissions.
Several studies carried out in a variety of rice-cropping systems reported an initial decrease of
rice yields after residue incorporation (Azam et al., 1991; Rao and Mikkelsen, 1976; Verma
and Bhagat, 1992) However, residue amendment may increase soil N supply after several
cropping seasons and thus does not adversely affect yield (Eagle et al., 2000). An obvious
benefit of residue amendment is the reduction of the still widely practised open-field burning
of rice straw in Southeast Asia, which is environmentally harmful and damaging to human
health (Gadde et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2013; Streets et al., 2003; Tipayarom and Qanh,
2007) In the longer run, straw amendment is also preferable to straw burning in terms of
nutrient return (Kimura et al., 1992).
CO2 emission from upland rice soil is mainly determined by soil moisture (Dossou-
Yovo et al., 2016). It was thus relatively high in the study reported here, as the experiment
28
Journal Pre-proof
was conducted during the wet season. Cyclic increases in CO2 emissions clearly resulted from
increased soil respiration after urea application (Tisdale et al., 1985). Rice straw residue
amendment tremendously increased the CO2 released from soil, which confirms the results of
previous studies (Bhattacharyya et al., 2012; Dossou-Yovo et al., 2016). Earthworms
increased CO2 emission in the treatments without straw addition, significantly reduced it after
rice straw amendment under conditions of low earthworm density (ET1), and did not cause a
significant reduction of CO2 emission after rice straw amendment under higher earthworm
density (ET2). This can probably be explained by the fact that the net effect of earthworms on
the amount of CO2 released from soil results from two opposing processes: the stimulation of
microbial metabolic activity by bioturbation (e.g. Lubbers et al., 2013; Parkin and Berry,
1999; Tiunov and Dobrovolskaya, 2002) and the physical protection of organic C in casts and
soil aggregates (Bossuyt et al., 2005; Pulleman and Marinissen, 2004). We hypothesize that
straw addition shifts the balance between these two processes from dominance of the former
to dominance of the latter at low earthworm densities. On the other hand, adding straw to soils
with high earthworm density may cause the two processes to mutually compensate each other.
Lubbers et al. (2017) reported a simultaneous increase of both, CO2 emission by stimulated
microbial activity and C stabilization in macro-aggregates under conditions of permanent
maize residue C availability by earthworm activity, however with a higher fraction of
mineralized than stabilized residue-derived C in the long run. The discrepancy between those
reported and the results which we obtained might be attributed to the fact that residue-derived
C was limited in our experimental system. Evidence thus suggests that the protection of
organic C in soil aggregates and earthworm casts may increase the sustainability of non-
flooded rice production systems in the long run by promoting C sequestration (Scheu and
Wolters, 1991; Wolters, 2000; Zhang et al., 2013).
29
Journal Pre-proof
In contrast to the usual view (e.g. Fonte and Six, 2010; Noguera et al., 2010; Xiao et
al., 2018), earthworm activity did not beneficially affect plant biomass and crop yield in our
experiment. The results nevertheless indicate that earthworms may at least partially
compensate for the yield loss induced by straw amendment (ET1). Van Groenigen et al.
(2014) found that the positive effects of earthworms on plant growth increased with
increasing amounts of crop residue return to the soil, but that this effect may disappear under
conditions of high soil N availability. The latter most probably applies to our experiment
conducted under conventional high fertilizer inputs. Depending on their lifeform, some
earthworm species can also have negative effects on plant growth and yields, e.g. by
increasing soil water loss (Edwards et al., 1992; Tomlin et al., 1995) and nutrient leaching
(Dominguez et al., 2004) as well as by feeding on plant roots (Curry and Schmidt, 2007;
Gunn and Cherrett, 1993). While no detrimental effects of Metaphire sp. on shoot biomass
and yield occurred in our experiment, we observed a decrease of root mass density in the
rhizosphere when earthworms were present under conditions of straw amendment. Since this
had no negative effect on crop production, however, reduced root mass density most probably
mainly reflects a plant response to improved soil conditions and nutrient availability in the
earthworm treatments (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2011; Laossi et al., 2010). This may have
additionally contributed to the earthworm-induced reductions of CH4 release, as root exudates
act as substrates for methanogenesis (Lu et al., 2000; Wassmann and Aulakh, 2000).
Conclusion
To conclude, earthworms have a remarkable potential for providing ecosystem
functions for the sustainable cultivation of upland crops in non-flooded tropical paddy soils,
such as rice residue decomposition, nutrient allocation and the reduction of crop residue
30
Journal Pre-proof
amendment-related increase of GHG release confined to CH4 without affecting N2O and CO2
emissions substantially, and neither crop productivity. Active earthworm management thus
can be an attractive and easy to implement strategy to promote alternative crop residue
disposal management following the ban on open field burning and to reduce straw-induced
CH emission. The actual mechanisms behind the presented results require further studies
including environmental and microbiological factors to be measured and long-term
observations would be helpful for both validating the findings of our study and investigating
the development of earthworm populations under field conditions.

"Earthworms offset straw-induced increase of greenhouse gas emission in upland
rice production"
Highlights
-
We tested if earthworms can mitigate residue-induced GHG emission in non-flooded rice.
-
Earthworms offset the enormous increase of CH4 induced by rice straw amendment.
-
Rice straw amendment more than doubled the global warming potential (GWP; CH4 &
N2O)
-
Earthworms reduced the GWP by 39 % at low and 55 % at high densities.
-
Earthworms did neither affect N2O emission, nor yield but reduced root mass density.
