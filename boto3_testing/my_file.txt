We conducted a field experiment on non-flooded rainfed rice fields, withand without residue amendment. In-situ mesocosms were inoculated with endogeicearthworms (Metaphire sp.), with either low (ET1: 150 individuals or high density (ET2:450 individuals m*2), and a control (ETO: no earthworms). We measured GHG emissions(methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); carbon dioxide (CO2)) twice a week during thecropping season with static chambers. Effects of earthworms on yield and root growth wereadditionally assessed. Earthworms offset the enormous increase of CH4 emissions induced bystraw amendment (from 4.6 + 5 to 75.3 + 46 kg CH4-C ha- in ETO). Earthworm activitysignificantly reduced CH4 release, particularly at ET2, by more than one-third (to 22 + 15 kgCH4-C In contrast, earthworm inoculation did not affect N2O emission. Strawamendment more than doubled the global warming potential (GWP). Earthworms reducedGWP by 39 % at low (ET1) and 55 % at high densities (ET2). Earthworm activity reducedroot mass density under conditions of straw amendment but did not affect yield. Earthwormscan significantly reduce detrimental effects of rice crop residue amendment on GHG releaseunder upland rice production. Organic carbon (C) might be preserved in earthworm casts andthereby limit C availability for CH4 production. At the same time, earthworm activity mightincrease methanotrophic CH4 consumption, due to improved soil aeration or less rootexudates. Consequently, earthworms have a strong potential for regulating ecosystemfunctions related to rice straw decomposition, nutrient allocation and thus GHG reduction.2Journal Pre-proofKeywords:Aerobic rice, soil fauna, residue decomposition, bioturbation, ecosystem services, globalwarming potential3Journal Pre-proof1 IntroductionThe mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, rice straw residue recycling andmanagement adaptations towards more sustainable rice production are among the majorchallenges for agriculture in Southeast Asia. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main staple food formore than half of the world's population (Khush, 2005). At the same time, global riceproduction contributes about 16 % to anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission and, althoughCH4's atmospheric concentration is much lower than that of carbon dioxide (CO2), its globalwarming potential (GWP) on a 100 year time span is approximately 28 times larger (IPCC,2014). Increasing water scarcity and Asia's rapid socio-economic development are drivingfarmers to transform their traditionally flooded double rice cropping systems into diversifiedrice crop rotations, including non-flooded crops such as upland (aerobic) rice or maize(Timsina et al., 2010; Wassmann et al., 2000, Belder et al., 2005). This, along with the needfor feasible and sustainable adaptation strategies in rice production, may create somesynergies in terms of CH4 emission. Recent studies have reported a reduction of CH4emissions of up to 84 % in a crop rotation of flooded rice and non-flooded upland rice ascompared to continuously flooded rice cultivation (Cha-un et al. ,2017), however,accompanied by an increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (Wassmann et al., 2000; Welleret al., 2016) The latter gas is also known for an extremely high GWP. The introduction ofupland crops into paddy rice systems goes along with a drastically altered water regime,leading not only to changes in the soil microbial community and its activity (Breidenbach etal., 2015; Breidenbach et al., 2017), but also in soil physicochemical properties. This createsthe possibility of establishing a more diverse soil fauna by promoting less flood-resistantspecies like earthworms (Schmidt et al., 2016).4Journal Pre-proofEarthworms and their effect on CH4 emissions are the subject of controversial debate,since the results of recent investigations range from a considerable reduction (Moon et al.,2010; Park et al., 2008) to an acceleration of methanogenic activity (Depkat-Jakob et al.,2012), with the latter being attributed to the stimulating effect of substrates from earthwormguts and in fresh casts. Generally, earthworms are considered to protect soil organic carbon(C) in their cast aggregates (Wolters, 2000). Elevated microbial activity in earthworm castsand burrow walls, however, may increase soil respiration rates (Kizilkaya and Hepsen, 2004;Parkin and Berry, 1999; Tiunov and Dobrovolskaya, 2002; Tiunov and Scheu, 1999). Andalso elevated N2O emissions due to earthworm activity as reported by Lubbers et al. (2013)may be mainly caused by microorganisms benefitting from improved metabolic conditions inboth intestines and casts of earthworms (Horn et al., 2003). Enhanced denitrification from thelatter leads to increased N2O emissions (Majeed et al., 2013). In contrast, several studies haveshown that earthworms increase CO2 but not N2O fluxes (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2010; Sperattiand Whalen, 2008) and even considerable reductions of N2O emission (Chen et al., 2014).Due to these partially contradictory results reported from various agroecosystems, there is stillsome uncertainty regarding the interplay of earthworm-induced soil organic matterstabilization and mobilization, as well as resulting GHG emissions. Consequently, it isimportant to measure all three GHGs from certain land use systems and managementpractices to be able to assess the contribution of earthworm activity to the net GHG balanceover time.Additional challenges for a comprehensive assessment of the role of earthworms inmaintaining C-storage and affecting GHG emissions from soils are associated with the effectsof crop residue return. Rice straw incorporation is becoming increasingly popular for nutrientreturn in rice agroecosystems (Janz et al., 2019) as an environmentally-friendly alternative tostraw burning (Huang et al., 2013). Rice straw open-field burning is still a widely practiced5Journal Pre-proofresidue disposal practice in the Philippines (Gadde et al., 2009). Despite the intuitivelypositive effects of straw burning associated with the rapid return of nutrients into the soil inash, those are outweigh by the negative influence of the organic matter combustion onclimate, air quality and public health (Huang et al., 2013; Streets et al., 2003; Tipayarom andOanh, 2007). Thus farmers have been encouraged to adopt alternative strategies for thedisposal of the relatively poor-quality rice straw residue material (Jiang et al., 2018). Ricestraw application has been reported to stabilize soil moisture and to improve soil fertility(Devevre and Horwath, 2000 Xia et al., 2014) At the same time, however, it may entail therisks of reducing rice production efficiencies (Mandal et al., 2004; Yadvinder-Singh et al.,2005) and increasing GHG emissions (Janz et al., 2019; Pandey et al., 2014; Sander andWassmann, 2014). The input of organic matter, such as rice residues, to rice soil promotesCH4 emissions (Bronson et 1.,1997; Wassmann et al., 2000) as it provides additionalsubstrate for methanogenic microorganisms (Le Mer and Roger, 2001) In non-flooded riceecosystems, however, rice residue amendment might be especially promising if accompaniedby natural colonization by earthworms or active soil fauna management. The presence ofearthworms may increase the benefits of straw amendment, as they can accelerate the initialdegradation of residue material (Lubbers et al., 2017), and thus positively affect plant growth(Fonte and Six, 2010; Noguera et al., 2010) Positive feedbacks of earthworms to nutrientdecomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth have long been recognized and are well-established (e.g. Brown et al., 1999; Darwin, 1881; Scheu, 2003; Wolters and Stickan, 1991;Xiao et al., 2018). This is mainly achieved by releasing nitrogen from the residue material andsoil organic matter (see e.g. van Groenigen et al., 2014). Brown et al. (1999) observed anaverage increase in plant growth of more than 50 % due to the presence of earthworms intropical soils, especially if accompanied by the application of additional organic C sources(Blouin et al., 2013; van Groenigen et al., 2014)6Journal Pre-proofEvidence from various agroecosystems suggests that the introduction of earthwormsinto paddy soils may considerably contribute to the regulation and stimulation of microbialcrop residue decomposition as well as to the improvement of nutrient availability for plants,while it may simultaneously mitigate GHG emissions (e.g. John et al., 2015; van Groenigen etal., 2014; Xiao et al., 2018) Before recommending earthworm addition or active promotion oflocal earthworm populations as a convenient measure for increasing the sustainablemanagement of upland rice soils amended with crop residues, however, it will be crucial tofully understand both the potential and the risks associated with earthworm effects on GHGemissions and crop productivity. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the pros and cons of theseeffects have never been experimentally quantified in the field. To fill this gap, we conducted afull-factorial experiment at non-flooded rainfed rice fields of the IRRI experimental farm (LosBanos, Philippines). The experiment was carried out in contained mesocosms with threedifferent levels of earthworm density (ETO: no earthworms, ET1: 150 ind. m-2 ET2: 450 ind.m-2) as well as with and without rice straw amendment. The impact of these treatments onGHG release and on the GWP was quantified by means of closed chamber measurements. Wemeasured both gas fluxes from bare soil and from soil with rice plants to better understand thepotential GHG mitigation by earthworm presence. We hypothesized that earthworm additionreduces the GWP after rice straw amendment by supressing the stimulation of CH4 emissionswithout boosting N2O and CO2 release. In addition, we determined treatment-specificdifferences in rice yield, shoot biomass and root mass density. The underlying hypothesis wasthat earthworm-induced physicochemical changes alter both growth and productivity of riceplants.7Journal Pre-proof2 Materials and Methods2.1 Field Site DescriptionThe field experiment was established at the experimental farm of the International RiceResearch Institute (IRRI), Los Banos, Philippines (60 km south of Manila). The site is locatedat 1409'45" N, 121015'35" E, at an elevation of 21 m above sea level. The cropping year isdetermined by a dry season (DS) and wet season (WS) as rainfall is unevenly distributed overthe year. 15 % of annual rainfall fells from Jan-May (DS) and 85 % fells in the period Jun-Dec (WS). The experiment was conducted during the rice cropping phase of the wet season2016 (July-October). The mean temperature during the cropping season was 28.9 C, with atotal rainfall of 1004 mm (IRRI Climate Unit 2016). The highest rainfall was recorded inSeptember 2016 (32.4 of total seasonal precipitation), due to a tropical storm at the end ofthe month. The soil had a clay-dominated texture (54.2 clay, 32.8 % silt, 13 % sand) and apH of 6.6. It was classified as "Andaqueptic Haplaquoll" (USDA classification) or"Anthraquic Gleysol" according to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources. Fieldmanagement was in accordance with the existing crop rotation scheme, alternating betweenmaize in the dry season and non-flooded upland rice in the wet season for four years beforethe start of the experiment.2.2 Set-Up of Contained Soil Mesocosms and Agronomic PracticeA total of 24 containments ("soil-plant mesocosms") were installed at two adjacent 14 m X 20m fields (12 each) to confine earthworms to the enclosed soil. Containment structures for thein-situ mesocosm experiment were made of plastic buckets with 60 cm diameter (= 0.28 m2surface area) and 70 cm height. Each was evenly perforated with 120 holes (5 cm diameter)8Journal Pre-proofthat were manually drilled in the side walls and the bottom of the buckets (Supplementarymaterial Figure S.2-A). 500 um nylon mesh fabric layered to the inside of the mesocosmsensured permeability for soil water, nutrients, microorganisms and soil mesofauna butprevented both escape of inoculated earthworms and invasion of local soil macrofauna (seee.g. Setala et al., 1996). Mesocosms were installed as soon as the usual land preparationpractice for upland rice cultivation had been carried out (see below). They were located at amaximum distance to the field boundaries (min. 3 m) and at a distance of 2.5 m between theexternal borders of adjacent mesocosms, to avoid edge effects and mutual interference. Themesocosms were buried in the ground to a depth of 60 cm (i.e. 10 cm still protruded aboveground) and filled with the original excavated soil. The soil was compacted to the surfacelevel of the surrounding field. When filling the mesocosms, care was taken to ensure that nocavities were created between the soil inside and outside of the containers to ensure maximumcoalescence. The soil used for the experiment was not defaunated, since earthworms wereabsent from the experimental fields after field preparation. Other soil macrofauna groups (e.g.gastropods or mole crickets) were manually removed.For land preparation, the fields were soaked for about one week before ploughing andharrowing until July 15, 2016 (see Supplementary material Table S.1 for the schedule of fieldactivities). The fields and contained mesocosms were manually levelled and mesocosm soilwas left undisturbed to settle for a few days before the transplanting of rice seedlings on July21, 2016 (Supplementary material Table S.1). Three-week-old dry-bed grown seedlings ofaerobic rice (NSIC Rc192) were manually transplanted in straight rows with equal distancesof 20 cm X 20 cm spacing between hills and one to two seedlings per hill. Each mesocosmwas planted with 7 hills in an identical pattern (see Supplementary material Figure S.2-B). Abasal fertilization of 30 kg ha- K (as potash) and 30 kg ha- P (as solophos) was conductedshortly after transplanting Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application occurred in three splits and9Journal Pre-proofquantities of 30, 50, and 50 kg urea-N ha at 8, 26 and 34 days after transplanting (DAT;Supplementary material Table S.1). Wooden planks were installed on July 25, 2016 (4 DAT)to reach the mesocosms while minimizing disturbance to surrounding rice plants. The fieldswere irrigated if necessary in case of drought, and drainage channels were opened in case ofheavy rainfall and subsequent flooding. Rice was harvested by hand on October 19, 2016 (90DAT).2.3 Straw and Earthworm TreatmentsThe experiment followed a full-factorial design of two different straw residue treatments andthree levels of earthworm densities in four replicates each. We established the fieldexperiment with 2 X 12 mesocosms in two bunded fields. One of the two fields received norice straw ("Without Straw'), while the other field received 6 Mg ha" air dried rice straw("With Straw'), partly incorporated during field-preparation (3 Mg ha-) and applied as mulchafter rice seedling transplanting (3 Mg ha to preserve soil moisture and avoid crackformation (Mousavi et al., 2012) Mesocosms in both fields were subject to three earthwormtreatments with zero (ETO), 150 (ET1) and 450 individuals (ind.) m2 (ET2), relating to 42 and126 mature individuals of the earthworm genus Metaphire sp. per mesocosm, respectively.Earthworms were collected from grasslands in close vicinity to the experimental sites. TheET1 earthworm density equals the natural abundance of the earthworm species in the originalhabitat, while ET2 represents a three-fold increased density treatment. To adapt to field soilconditions, earthworms were incubated in a styrofoam box filled with soil from theexperimental field for five days prior to mesocosm inoculation. After rice transplanting,earthworms were transferred to the respective mesocosms on August 1, 2016 (11 DAT). SeeSupplementary material Figure S.1 for a dimensionally accurate schematic overview of the10Journal Pre-prooffield experimental design and Supplementary material Table S.1 for the field activityschedule.After harvest, all mesocosm containers were removed from the fields and the soil wasmanually examined to count for earthworms. We recovered an average of 27 + 5 and 61 + 22individuals for the ET1 and ET2 treatments, respectively. Despite the apparently lowrecovery, the difference between the two earthworm treatments was still significant (P <0.001) Moreover, the recovery rate was not affected by the initial earthworm density (ET1:64.6 + 11.8 % ET2: 48.5 + 16.0 % P = 0.452) and is within the usual range reported for thistype of experiment (Lubbers and van Groenigen, 2013; Paul et al., 2012; van Groenigen et al.,2014). Straw application did not affect the recovery rate either (P - 0.755).Bulk soil and rhizosphere soil (0-10 cm & 10-20 cm depth) were manually collectedwith soil corers (3 cm in diameter) at the beginning (10 DAT) and after the experiment (2DAH) within each confinement for analyses of the soil C and N amount using a CN elementalanalyser (Vario Max, Hanau, Germany).2.4 Greenhouse Gas MeasurementsSoil CH4, CO2 and N2O gas fluxes were measured using manually operated static closedchambers consisting of a permanent frame installed in the field and mobile measurementchambers. Two chamber frames were installed at each of the 24 mesocosms, one coveringbare soil without plants (N-frames) and one covering the middle hill including the rice plants(P-frames), and remained installed for the duration of the experiment (see Supplementarymaterial Figure S.2-B). While P-chamber measurements captured emissions from soil, roots,and rice plants, N-chamber measurements were not directly affected by plants However, asN-chamber fluxes are also influenced by roots and associated rhizosphere processes that11Journal Pre-proofextend over the entire soil matrix, we were aware that they do not only measure bare soilemissions.N-frames consisted of a circular plastic (PVC) base frame (25 cm length, 15 cm indiameter), inserted 10 cm into the soil of each mesocosm between hills, covering bare soilwith no plant inside The respective N-chambers were made of non-transparent PVC pipingmaterial with a fixed height of 11.5 cm (6.5 cm overlap, 15 cm in diameter), resulting in atotal height of 20 cm when attached to the base frame.P-frames consisted of a larger circular base frame (25 cm in diameter, 20cm length),inserted about 10 cm into the soil, covering the middle hill of rice plants in each mesocosm,with an above-ground frame height of another 10 cm. The respective P-chambers wereconstructed from semi-transparent, plastic water gallons with a diameter of 25.5 cm and usedin variable chamber heights (35, 65, 95, 120 cm), depending on the height of the plant insidethe chamber. The overlap of frame and chamber was covered with a 3.5 cm rubber band,forming an airtight seal.Both chamber types were equipped with ports for gas sampling, a thermometer and avent for pressure equilibration. Gas samples were collected from inside the chambers using a60 mL syringe at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min time points after chamber closure. A battery-poweredfan was installed inside the P-chambers to ensure a well-mixed air sample, particularly withincreasing chamber size. The air inside the N-chambers was thoroughly mixed by flushingthree times with the 60 mL volume of the sampling syringe right before each sampling. A 10mL glass vial with butyl rubber septum was flushed (30 mL) with sample air before it wasfilled and over pressurized with 15 mL of the same sample Sampling took place twice a weekduring the entire rice growing season (11-88 DAT; 23 measurement days in total) between8:30 and 10:30 a.m. to capture the mean of diurnal variabilities, according to protocol settings(e.g. Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2016, Sander and Wassmann, 2014). Soil temperature and water12Journal Pre-prooffilled pore space (WFPS) were monitored during each measurement occasion (seeSupplementary material Figure S.3). The gas samples were transported to Germany andanalysed with a gas chromatograph (GC; 8610C SRI Instruments) equipped with an Nielectron capture detector (ECD) for analysis of N2O, and a flame ionization detector (FID)and methanizer for analysis of CH4 and CO2.Hourly flux rates were calculated by linear regression of the four measurement points,based on the ideal gas law, and corrected by chamber air temperature and air pressure(Minamikawa et al., 2015) The daily gas flux was calculated by multiplying the mean hourlygas flux by 24. Cumulative seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated from the dailyemissions between every two consecutive measurements from the P- and N-chamber averageusing linear interpolation. Interpolated daily gas fluxes were summed up to calculate theemissions for vegetative (0-25 DAT), reproductive (26-55 DAT), and ripening (56-90 DAT)growth stages as well as total seasonal emissions. The GWP (CH4 and N2Q) was estimatedusing the radiative forcing potentials (relative to CO2, for a 100-year time horizon without theinclusion of climate-C feedback), i.e. 265 and 28 for N2O and CH4, respectively (Myhre et al.,2013). GWP was averaged across P- and N-chambers. CO2 fluxes were only used to analysethe relative changes of treatment effects from chambers without plants (N), but not includedin the calculations of seasonal emissions and GWP, because they were affected by plantphotosynthesis in P-chambers.2.5 Rice Yield, Shoot Biomass and Root Mass Density AssessmentAbove-ground biomass was harvested from the mesocosms on October 19, 2016 (90 DAT)and analysed for rice grain yield (corrected to 14% moisture content), dry weight of strawand harvest index, following the ORYZA 2000 crop data collection protocol (IRRI, 2009).13Journal Pre-proofRoot mass density was determined as described by Henry et al. (2012) as a proxy forroot production under field conditions. The respective soil cores (60 cm in depth, 3 cm indiameter) were sampled two days after harvest (Supplementary material Table S.1) within themesocosms in between two hills. Each soil core was cut into four pieces, which wereseparately placed on sieves (355 um) and washed under running water to separate soilparticles from the rice roots. The roots were dried for 48 hours at 63C before weighing. Totalroot mass density per mesocosm was calculated by summing up the resulting root weights ofthe four pieces of the respective soil cores. Root mass values were converted to g (dry weight)cm-3 according to the soil core volume.2.6 Statistical AnalysisGHG fluxes (CH4, N2O, and CO2) were analysed using the general linear model procedure inR (version 3.4.3) with forward and backward stepwise inclusion of variables. Independentcategorical predictors were "earthworm" (three levels), "'straw application" (two levels),"chamber type" (two levels), "growth stage" (three levels of rice growth: the vegetativegrowth stage, the reproductive and the ripening stage, to examine inter-seasonal dynamics ofthe earthworm treatments on GHG release during the cropping season) as well as theirinteractions. Dependent variables were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity ofvariance and adjusted by logarithmic transformation if they did not meet the criteria.Seasonal cumulative GHG emissions were analysed for the impact of earthworm andstraw residue treatment as well as of chamber type (P- and N-chambers) by means of multiplefactorial analyses of variance (ANOVA, R package "agricolae" V. 1.2-8). Hence, seasonalcumulative GHG emission was analysed for each growth stage with chamber type as fixedeffect, while replication was the random effect.14Journal Pre-proofGWP as well as plant parameters (rice yield, shoot biomass, root mass density) werecompared across earthworm and straw residue treatments. Multiple comparisons amongtreatment means were performed using the Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significantdifference) test on a probability level of 5 % or lower (R package "agricolae" V. 1.2-8).15Journal Pre-proof3 Results3.1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions3.1.1 Methane FluxEarthworm density and straw application significantly affected the magnitude of CH4 fluxesduring aerobic rice cultivation (Table 1). Earthworms significantly decreased seasonalcumulative emissions in the treatment with straw application by 43 and 71 % under ET1 andET2, respectively (Table 2). Significant interactions between straw and earthworm treatmentthus suggest a strong modulation of earthworm effects by the addition of rice straw as anadditional C source (Table 1). On average, rice straw application increased CH4 emissions byafactor of 10 (Table 2). Only in the field without straw amendment were occasional increasesin CH4 flux observed when earthworms were present during the vegetative or reproductivegrowth stage (Figure 1). However, the magnitude of CH4 emission was on a very low levelcompared to the field receiving rice straw (Table 2).CH4 emissions were increased by rice plants inside the measurement chambers (P-chambers compared to N-chambers; Table 1). Total seasonal emissions accumulated to 19.8 +9.5 kg CH4-C ha-l in chambers without and to 31.4 + 8.7 kg CH4-C ha- with rice plants. Mostof the CH4 (80-99 % %) was emitted during vegetative and reproductive growth stages,irrespective of plants and straw residues (Figure 1). During these earlier growth stages,significantly larger amounts of CH4 were detected in mesocosms without earthworminoculation compared to mesocosms with ET2 earthworm inoculation under conditions of ricestraw residue amendment (Table 2). ET1 significantly reduced cumulative CH4 emissions aswell, but only in N-chambers (Table 2). This effect was negligible in P-chambers.Peak emissions in chambers with and without plants were reached at 28 DAT. Afterthat, magnitude and variation of flux measurements gradually decreased during the16Journal Pre-proofreproductive growth stage until 43 DAT and remained low for the rest of the season (Figure1).

The strongly elevated CH4 emissions under rice straw application significantlyincreased the GWP (P < 0.001; Figure 2). Average emissions, equal to 2007 kg CO2-C ha"season occurred when straw was amended, which is more than twice as high as compared tothe field without residue input (854.6 kg CO2-C eq. ha- season)Earthworm presence significantly supressed the stimulating effect of straw amendmenton CH4 production and thereby reduced the GWP during upland rice cultivation (Figure 2). Astrong modulation of straw-induced CH4 emissions by earthworm presence and density wassuggested by the significant interaction effect (P < 0.05). The highest seasonal peak in GWPoccurred shortly after rice straw residue amendment (ETO: 2927.9 kg CO2-C eq. ha- seasonFigure 2). ET1 and ET2 supressed that instant stimulating effect of straw amendment on CH4production (Table 2) and consequently reduced the GWP by 39 % and 55 %, respectively(Figure 2), mainly caused by differences during vegetative and reproductive growth stages.No earthworm effect on GWP was observed in mesocosms without rice straw residueamendment.22Journal Pre-proof4000CH4 Eq.a3500N2O Eq.300025002000abb1500bb1000bT500OETOET1ET2ETOET1ET2without Strawwith StrawFigure 2: Seasonal global warming potential (GWP; CH4 + N2O) of upland rice cropping asaffected by three earthworm (ETO, ET1 and ET2) and two rice straw residue ("WithoutStraw" and "With Straw") treatments.

Grain yield, in contrast, though not affected byearthworms, was significantly reduced by straw amendment (Supplementary material TableS.2; Table 5).

Only under earthworm density ET1 were rice yields practicallyidentical with and without straw residue amendment (Table 5).Root mass density was significantly reduced by earthworm activity in fields with ricestraw residue amendment (Supplementary material Table S.2; Table 5). Particularly the ET1earthworm density resulted in the lowest root mass density (21.1 + 2.5 g cm-3 Supplementarymaterial Table S.2), significantly different from mesocosms without earthworms (ETO: 49.7 +7.6 g cm-3; Table 5).Table 5: Effect of earthworm density and rice straw residue amendment on mean (+ SE) Rootmass density, Straw dry mass, Grain yield and Harvest Index.

No treatment-related significant differences were observedfor the concentration change of C or N, and C/N ratio between any of the straw residue orearthworm treatments (see Supplementary material Table S.3).24Journal Pre-proofDiscussionThe experiment reported here demonstrates a considerable potential of native earthworms tomitigate increased CH4 emissions and GWP (CH4 and N2O) induced by rice straw addition tonon-flooded paddy soils. This is supported by earlier findings implicating that earthwormsincrease the sustainability of agricultural systems as they modify nutrient allocation, GHGemission, and plant productivity by affecting soil conditions, microbial communitycomposition and crop residue decomposition (Byers et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2015; Lavelleet al., 2016). The promotion of local earthworm populations thus seems to provide a feasiblemanagement option for increasing the sustainability of upland rice production.Rice straw amendment per se detrimentally affected crop yield, strongly increasedCO2 emissions and CH4 release, and ultimately raised GWP (CH4 and N2O) by more than 400%. This was accompanied by a shift from N2O to CH4 as the major contributor to total GWP.The effect of crop residues on CH4 and CO2 production was earlier explained by a number ofmechanisms (e.g. microbial activity stimulation) (Conrad, 2002; Glissmann and Conrad,2006; Kimura et al., 2004), but based on the set of parameters that we measured, we can onlyspeculate which mechanisms were realistic in our experimental fields. Our experiment wasconducted under well-drained, aerobic soil conditions. However, wet season rainfall events(Supplementary material Figure S.3) coupled with straw addition may have occasionally ledto anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (Janz et al. 2019). According to Rath et al.(2005), CH4 emissions from non-flooded rice fields amended with rice straw can be almost ashigh as those from flooded fields without residue addition. CH emission was highest shortlyafter straw addition and gradually decreased during the cropping season to zero at ripeningThis further demonstrates that CH4 release strongly depends on the availability of non-metabolized crop residues and fades with progressing state of decomposition.25Journal Pre-proofThe potential of earthworms to mitigate CH4 emission has been shown by severalauthors for various soil types and environmental conditions (e.g. Kernecker et al., 2014;Moon et al., 2010; Park et al., 2008) Our results suggest, however, that this effect isparticularly pronounced when the proportion of undecomposed organic material is high.Earthworm-induced reductions of CH4 release after rice straw addition to non-saturated paddysoils may be the result of a variety of processes. First, earthworm activity may limit Cavailability for methanogenic archaea by stabilizing and physically protecting straw-derived Csources in soil macro- and microaggregates (Bossuyt et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2017) Then,earthworms may stimulate the growth and activity of methanotrophic bacteria (Kim et al.,2011; Moon et al., 2010; Park et al., 2008). And finally, by increasing the diffusion rate ofoxygen into the soil profile, earthworms may decrease the availability of favourable anoxicmicrosites for methanogens (Kernecker et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016). In our study,earthworm-related mitigation of CH4 emission was particularly strong at the beginning of thecropping season, and lasted until approx. 40 DAT, when most of the straw was decomposed.Even the sharp increase in CH4 release caused by heavy rains and the associated increase ofwater saturation at 20-30 DAT (Neue et al., 1996) was significantly buffered in the earthwormtreatments. Thus, in contrast to a microcosm experiment with the earthworm Pheretima sp.(John et al., 2015), the addition of Metaphire sp. does not seem to increase the risk of CH4emissions under conditions of high inflow of water in the field. These seeminglycontradictory results can most probably be explained by the fact that endogeic earthwormsincreased the porosity of soils and, thus, promoted the accumulation of backwater in thebottom layers of soil-filled microcosms but increased water outflow under field conditions(Trojan and Linden, 1992). The strong increase of CH4 emissions (factor > 2.6) inmeasurement chambers with rice plants compared to those without plants is in accordancewith Butterbach-Bahl et al. (1997), who reported that a high proportion of CH4 is transported26Journal Pre-proofthrough rice plants' aerenchymatous stem tissue. Earthworms were most effective inmitigating bare soil-derived CH4 emission between rice plants (N), but only reduced CH4release in plant covered areas (P) at high density (ET2). With increasing earthworm density,more individuals probably entered the root zone, where they altered rhizodeposited Cresources (Shao et al., 2019) and thus affected CH4 emission. Interestingly, such effects arevisible only after straw amendment.Earthworm effects on N2O emission were limited to treatments without rice strawamendment. The significant, yet short-term increase in N2O emissions after fertilizerapplication during the reproductive growth stage observed at ET1 and ET2 partly supports thefindings of other authors (Borken et al., 2000; Lubbers et al., 2011; Lubbers et al., 2013;Marhan et al., 2010; Rizhiya et al., 2007). However, it contradicts the earthworm-inducedreduction of net N2O release from rice soil reported by Chen et al. (2014). Plant N uptake andthe diffusion of N2O to the atmosphere may both be increased by improved soil aeration andporosity as a result of high earthworm activity (ET2) The increase of N2O emissionsnevertheless was much lower in our study than postulated in other studies (Borken et al.,2000; Lubbers et al., 2013; Lubbers et al., 2011), particularly after residue amendment(Giannopoulos et al., 2010; Rizhiya et al., 2007). One explanation might be that differentfunctional groups of earthworms can have quite contrasting effects on GHG emissions (seee.g. Majeed et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). For example, denitrifying microorganisms do notseem to be affected in the same way in the gut of Metaphire sp. as has been reported for otherearthworm species (Horn et al., 2003). The cyclic increase of N2O release in our experimentcan partly be explained by the obvious association between N2O evolution and N fertilizerapplication (Bouwman et al., 2002). Additionally, N2O emission peaks might have beentriggered by dry-wet alternations resulting from heavy rainfall events between two dry periods(11-18 DAT and 35-54 DAT) (Zou et al., 2005). Whether the improvement of soil aeration by27Journal Pre-proofearthworm activity contributes to the buffering of such dry-wet cycle induced peaks of N2Oemission has to be tested in the future.We did not detect any effect of straw amendment on N2O flux at any time of thecropping season, although rice residue addition is thought to increase N uptake by plants(Verma and Bhagat, 1992). Yao et al. (2017) recently described strongly diminished N2Oemissions after straw amendment, with improved N use efficiency by plants and henceincreased yields from wheat-based crop rotations in China. However, this did not occur in ourexperiment carried out under conditions of aerobic upland rice cropping. Rice straw is aresidue with relatively poor-quality, due to low N content, a high C/N ratio as well as highlignin and polyphenol contents (Jiang et al., 2018) Therefore, its decomposition bears the riskof microbial immobilization of N (Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2005), which can lead to negativeshort-term effects on crop production. However, proper N-fertilization management (e.g. 130kg N in three splits as in this experiment) can reduce N immobilization after strawamendment (Eagle et al., 2000; Mandal et al., 2004), but can also allow N2O emissions.Several studies carried out in a variety of rice-cropping systems reported an initial decrease ofrice yields after residue incorporation (Azam et al., 1991; Rao and Mikkelsen, 1976; Vermaand Bhagat, 1992) However, residue amendment may increase soil N supply after severalcropping seasons and thus does not adversely affect yield (Eagle et al., 2000). An obviousbenefit of residue amendment is the reduction of the still widely practised open-field burningof rice straw in Southeast Asia, which is environmentally harmful and damaging to humanhealth (Gadde et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2013; Streets et al., 2003; Tipayarom and Qanh,2007) In the longer run, straw amendment is also preferable to straw burning in terms ofnutrient return (Kimura et al., 1992).CO2 emission from upland rice soil is mainly determined by soil moisture (Dossou-Yovo et al., 2016). It was thus relatively high in the study reported here, as the experiment28Journal Pre-proofwas conducted during the wet season. Cyclic increases in CO2 emissions clearly resulted fromincreased soil respiration after urea application (Tisdale et al., 1985). Rice straw residueamendment tremendously increased the CO2 released from soil, which confirms the results ofprevious studies (Bhattacharyya et al., 2012; Dossou-Yovo et al., 2016). Earthwormsincreased CO2 emission in the treatments without straw addition, significantly reduced it afterrice straw amendment under conditions of low earthworm density (ET1), and did not cause asignificant reduction of CO2 emission after rice straw amendment under higher earthwormdensity (ET2). This can probably be explained by the fact that the net effect of earthworms onthe amount of CO2 released from soil results from two opposing processes: the stimulation ofmicrobial metabolic activity by bioturbation (e.g. Lubbers et al., 2013; Parkin and Berry,1999; Tiunov and Dobrovolskaya, 2002) and the physical protection of organic C in casts andsoil aggregates (Bossuyt et al., 2005; Pulleman and Marinissen, 2004). We hypothesize thatstraw addition shifts the balance between these two processes from dominance of the formerto dominance of the latter at low earthworm densities. On the other hand, adding straw to soilswith high earthworm density may cause the two processes to mutually compensate each other.Lubbers et al. (2017) reported a simultaneous increase of both, CO2 emission by stimulatedmicrobial activity and C stabilization in macro-aggregates under conditions of permanentmaize residue C availability by earthworm activity, however with a higher fraction ofmineralized than stabilized residue-derived C in the long run. The discrepancy between thosereported and the results which we obtained might be attributed to the fact that residue-derivedC was limited in our experimental system. Evidence thus suggests that the protection oforganic C in soil aggregates and earthworm casts may increase the sustainability of non-flooded rice production systems in the long run by promoting C sequestration (Scheu andWolters, 1991; Wolters, 2000; Zhang et al., 2013).29Journal Pre-proofIn contrast to the usual view (e.g. Fonte and Six, 2010; Noguera et al., 2010; Xiao etal., 2018), earthworm activity did not beneficially affect plant biomass and crop yield in ourexperiment. The results nevertheless indicate that earthworms may at least partiallycompensate for the yield loss induced by straw amendment (ET1). Van Groenigen et al.(2014) found that the positive effects of earthworms on plant growth increased withincreasing amounts of crop residue return to the soil, but that this effect may disappear underconditions of high soil N availability. The latter most probably applies to our experimentconducted under conventional high fertilizer inputs. Depending on their lifeform, someearthworm species can also have negative effects on plant growth and yields, e.g. byincreasing soil water loss (Edwards et al., 1992; Tomlin et al., 1995) and nutrient leaching(Dominguez et al., 2004) as well as by feeding on plant roots (Curry and Schmidt, 2007;Gunn and Cherrett, 1993). While no detrimental effects of Metaphire sp. on shoot biomassand yield occurred in our experiment, we observed a decrease of root mass density in therhizosphere when earthworms were present under conditions of straw amendment. Since thishad no negative effect on crop production, however, reduced root mass density most probablymainly reflects a plant response to improved soil conditions and nutrient availability in theearthworm treatments (Chapuis-Lardy et al., 2011; Laossi et al., 2010). This may haveadditionally contributed to the earthworm-induced reductions of CH4 release, as root exudatesact as substrates for methanogenesis (Lu et al., 2000; Wassmann and Aulakh, 2000).ConclusionTo conclude, earthworms have a remarkable potential for providing ecosystemfunctions for the sustainable cultivation of upland crops in non-flooded tropical paddy soils,such as rice residue decomposition, nutrient allocation and the reduction of crop residue30Journal Pre-proofamendment-related increase of GHG release confined to CH4 without affecting N2O and CO2emissions substantially, and neither crop productivity. Active earthworm management thuscan be an attractive and easy to implement strategy to promote alternative crop residuedisposal management following the ban on open field burning and to reduce straw-inducedCH emission. The actual mechanisms behind the presented results require further studiesincluding environmental and microbiological factors to be measured and long-termobservations would be helpful for both validating the findings of our study and investigatingthe development of earthworm populations under field conditions.31Journal Pre-proofAcknowledgementsThis work was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) as part of the ResearchGroup FOR 1701 ICON ("Introducing Non-Flooded Crops in Rice-Dominated Landscapes:Impacts on Carbon, Nitrogen and Water Cycles" (BU1173/13-2) subprojects: "Influence oftrophic interactions in soil on carbon and nitrogen turnover" (WO670/15-1) and "Greenhousegas emission of different crop rotations of rice (flooded and non-flooded) and maize"(KI1431/3-2).
